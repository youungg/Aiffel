      "[b\"The planning episodes were a bit dull, but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch. The reason why I call it the most realistic reality show is because, much to my surprise,Charley fell out of the race relatively early. When his hands were sore, I expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix, but instead he actually quit the race. The most anxious moment of the show must've been when Max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food! The ending was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the team make it. Overall, not as great as the Long Way Round, but definitely an interesting watch, as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world.\"\n",
      " b'Dwight Yoakam must be a hell of a guy. He\\'s personable in interviews, plays and sings his own music with panache, and did a great job of acting in \"Slingblade\". He\\'s such a cool guy that he was able to get a lot of his friends to be in a really bad Western.  I love a good Western. They\\'re especially scarce these days, but this was not one of them. Most people would consider this movie unwatchable, but I stayed with it because I hoped it would get better.  There are a few reasons to see this movie, but not exceptionally strong reasons. One of them was Paul Reuben aka Pee-wee Herman who plays a bad guy named Arvil. That\\'s right - Pee-wee Herman is a bad guy... and he\\'s good at it. I used to make jokes about Pee-wee taking on Chuck Norris in a movie, but after seeing him in this, maybe it\\'s not so far fetched. Reubens does a great job of creating a sadistic, quick tempered little man even with poor direction and writing.  Let\\'s talk about the screenplay a little. Dialogue seems clumsy and sluggish. It\\'s as if the language mired that action in General Store bought molasses. My hunch would be that Billy Bob Thorton wrote his own lines because they\\'re not even on the same planet as the rest of the cast in the movie. Thorton is fun to watch, even if I had a hard time understanding what he was saying. Maybe it because I was focusing on the guy playing his sidekick. I didn\\'t see until the credits Thorton\\'s sidekick was the late great songwriter Warren Zevon.  What there is of a plot is hard to follow. The whole movie is awkward and unfocused. On the plus side, the scenery is nice and most shots are well lit.  \"South of Heaven, West of Hell\" is inaccurately described as a surreal Western. \"El Topo\" is a surreal Western (and much better film). Surreal shouldn\\'t be a synonym for sloppy.'\n",
      " b'An unleashed, nonstop documentation of one man\\'s thinly veiled attempt to annoy every available woman and prostitute he can find the nerve to approach. His addiction is not so much to having sex with prostitutes, but to endlessly approaching them, pricing the act, and then saying \"I\\'ll have to think about it.\" Lather, rinse, repeat, with every opportunity taken to confess his every thought to his current girlfriend in the supposed interests of honesty and openness.  The redeeming realism of the film crops up in a fairly straightforward reporting of the hideous effects of this behavior. Do not expect much fun from the sexual adventures - there\\'s some fairly graphic content, but it\\'s about as joyless as it comes.'\n",
      " b'after hearing about this film since the 80s, i finally got the chance to see it and was seriously disappointed. it\\'s only slightly unusual and not at all funny. i was under the impression that mysterious possessed cars attack a town in a campy hysterical \"attack of the killer tomatos\" style.  the cars are just human driven customs and very little actually happens in the film. there\\'s one or two chuckles, but there are many more wierder and/or funnier b-movies out there more deserving of a \"rep\" than this one.  it\\'s like a watered down \"present day\" version of \"the road warrior\" without any of that film\\'s charm. it may have been the influence for it though as the \"helicopter jockey\" plays a small part in this film.  worth seeing if you have to see every cult film ever made, but not if you need to stay awake.   4 out of 10 overrated as a classic b-movie.'\n",
      " b\"This is a movie I went back and forth on seeing. I'd see a commercial and think it would be terrible. Then I'd see the trailer while waiting for another movie and think it would be good. Finally I decided to go. This was a tragic mistake. For a couple of minutes, though, it was looking pretty good. I was getting prepared for an intimate look at how sane, educated people handle adult relationships. Then the opening credits ended and there's David Duchovny, talking to his son while he (the son) is on the toilet and explaining how a fart can be better than a poop. It didn't get any better from there.  Not counting porn, this is the worst-written film I have ever seen. Now there are plenty of badly-written movies out there, but they don't pretend to be anything other than a crude vehicle that gets you to the CGI, stunts, and/or bloodshed. This is even worse than those because Bart Freundlich thought it was going to be about something important, and it's just absolute junk. The characters in this movie do not exist in real life. They have no depth or dimensions or personalities. They are all completely unlikable. (I started applauding when Duchovny tells Billy Crudup's character to shut the hell up. You and me both, David.) They don't talk or think like anyone I've ever come across. They float from wildly expensive restaurant to wildly expensive restaurant and whine about their problems without ever stopping to think that they are the cause of them all. Would you want to sit through an hour and 40 minutes of rich, pampered, pretty white people living in a bubble and complaining about how much their lives suck? I didn't think so.  But wait, there's more. The script makes Maggie Gyllenhaal look like a sniveling, whiny private-school sorority girl. That alone is an art crime against humanity. But considering Crudup is reduced to a one-note death-obsessed Neanderthal, and Duchovny ends up speaking jive during a particularly bigoted note in the script, and the whole thing wraps up like a teen drama on the CW, I think I'm on pretty solid ground with my assertion.  Yes, it only deserves 1 star. I thought to myself: Was there anything of value that I could take from this movie and justify giving it maybe 2 or 3 stars? There might have been, but the movie was such an insult to me and other smart people that I decided it wasn't worth it to figure out what they were.\"\n",
      " b'Following a car accident, a mad scientist(Jason Evers) keeps the head of his fiancee(Virgina Leith)alive. He then goes on the prowl looking for the perfect body to make her whole again. Pretty lame all the way around, nothing redeeming here. Also in the cast are: Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton. Someone should have helped put this one out of its misery. Let it die.'\n",
      " b\"Basically, It was like a pretty good movie with a really bad ending. The problem with the main event is that there is a tradition with Wrestlemania where the good guys win in the end. Why they had to change it for this one, I have no idea. This was the perfect chance to give Mick Foley the send-off he deserved. He could've retired as WWF champion. But what happened? Triple H wins the match with a screw job finish. The match itself had some good points, like the final teaming of the Rock and Sock Connection. Aside from that, the Main sucked!  The undercard went from decent to classic. I am primarily referring to the first three-way tag ladder match between the Dudley's, Edge and Christian, and The Hardy's. Spectacular.  You can also throw in the triple threat, double title match featuring Benoit, Jericho, and Angle. It was great to see Benoit and Jericho as champions by the end of that match. And yes, I know Benoit was a heel in that one, but Vince was an idiot to make him one in the first place.  Of course, Vince being an idiot might explain the crappy ratings they've had over the past year or so.\"\n",
      " b'What can I say? This is a wonderful, gentle film, the kind, sadly, Hollywood no longer makes. I saw it first twenty years ago, and it haunted me ever since; I try to watch it once every couple of years. Fontaine and Cotten are in top form here, as are all the supporting actors (especially Tandy). The plot is absolute escapist romantic fare, which I\\'ll leave others to describe. While on the surface the main catch may seem far-fetched, it\\'s handled with surprising credibility; one cannot help but feel caught up in the lovers\\' dilemma. Given their once-in-a-million opportunity, would any of us have done anything different? Can we judge them?   But, despite the outstanding acting and story, the real stars here are the music and the Italian settings. The haunting song \"September Affair,\" played in the film, was recorded shortly before Walter Huston\\'s death and released posthumously; the poignancy of this fact, and the skillful usage in the film, made both a huge sensation. The captivating black-and-white Italian scenery, especially in Rome and Capri (check out the awesome sequence in the cave at Capri) is worth watching just by itself - much of the same would be captured later in Technicolor (but not as effectively) in the film Rome Adventure. An unforgettable viewing experience; if you love escapism and romance, don\\'t miss this one.'\n",
      " b'\\'Intervention\\' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. I\\'m a middle-aged married father of two. I\\'m quite functional in my personal and professional life. Still, I have pain from my past that I use addictions to soothe, and issues from which I am slowly recovering. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family.  The show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it\\'s too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, \"the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood.\" The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. This digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. Often it\\'s assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self-interest, and now they can\\'t stop. Not so: addictions are about killing pain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people\\'s lives. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. To those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some kids handle divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, \"collapse in a heap on the floor\" and have their lives forever changed by the event.  For example, last night\\'s counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men. She strips for cash for a 75-year old neighbor and lets men abuse her. Sound familiar to anyone? The series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives. Often it\\'s those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it\\'s made your life miserable.  To the producers: Thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. Also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant.  To the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. Whether or not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.'\n",
      " b'A high level of nervous tension is giving overbearing screecher Laura Van Ee (Molly Lamont) some heart problems. Unhappily married to Ward (Roland Varno) and living in a large mansion/clinic with her hubby and his doctor father Josef (George Zucco), Laura believe someone\\'s trying to kill her. And apparently she is correct in her assumption since the film is narrated by her fresh corpse on a morgue slab. The film frequently closes in on her body, the screen goes wavy and the film settles into flashback mode as she narrates her own story. Too bad she isn\\'t even present for the majority of it! Laura, a former singer in Paris, now thinks she is being held prisoner in her home by Ward and her father-in-law. She hears strange noises and someone sends her a dummy head in a package to try to drive her even more bonkers. After that set-up during the first 20 minutes or so, the film seems to forget all about Laura until the very end of the film, when some absurd, out-of-left field explanation is given about how she was literally \"scared to death\" by someone from her past who has returned to settle an old score.  So what happens during the majority of this film? Unfortunately, it has little to do with Laura\\'s predicament and more to do with a crew of irritating, chattery side characters trying (and usually failing) to be amusing. Nat Pendleton plays an extremely annoying bumbling detective named Bill Raymond, who hangs out in the home hoping someone is killed so he can solve the case and get his old job back (?) There\\'s also put-upon maid Lilly Beth (Gladys Blake), who Bill seems obsessed with and who finds herself clinically dead at one point. Add to the mix reporter Terry Lee (Douglas Fowley), his airhead girlfriend Jane Cornell (Joyce Compton), Josef\\'s estranged hypnotist cousin Professor Leonide (Bela Lugosi), Leonide\\'s deaf-mute dwarf sidekick Indigo (Angelo Rossitto), blackmailer Mrs. Williams (Dorothy Christie) and someone wearing a green expressionless mask peaking in windows from time to time. This film has far too many pointless characters, far too many dull, talky scenes that really have nothing to do with the plot and completely fails at being a horror film, mystery OR comedy.  The film\\'s chief notoriety is being both Lugosi\\'s only starring role in a color feature and his only color horror effort. Unfortunately, Bela is underutilized here and seems to disappear for lengthy stretches, though his presence in general will be enough of an incentive for fans to check this out. Same goes for horror star Zucco, who plays his role completely straight but has almost nothing to do. The run-time is a measly 68 minutes, but that doesn\\'t keep this misfire from dragging on and on and on for what seems like an eternity.'\n",
      " b'Luis Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel\\'s \"The Phantom of Liberty\" is definitely a thought-provoking film. His surrealist approach to film questions society\\'s rules and customs. Though the scenes are quite bizarre, they still manage to feel \"right.\" The way in which they question the social order of things is like a visual manifestation and elaboration of questions I have asked myself. The contradictions Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel proudly exhibits are fabulous. People have been brought up to think a certain way and expect certain things, and Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel\\'s humorous defiance of our expectations makes one think about where our expectations come from, and how legitimate they really are. And yet, everything is done with a lot of fun. \"The Phantom of Liberty\" is like a philosophical discussion about life and individuality and independence of thought made into a movie. I really liked it because it truly made me think about why I am the way I am. It\\'s a good movie to see. I definitely recommend it.'\n",
      " b'Like Ishtar and King of Comedy, other great, misunderstood comedies, Envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially, losers (may be too harsh a word, I will call them suburban under-achievers).  This film was a dark comedy gem, and I\\'m not sure what people expect. I relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn\\'t filled with obvious humor, and I believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile. The look on Stiller\\'s face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment, a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (the J-Man\\'s decrepit \"cabin by the lake\", Corky\\'s unceremonious burial, Weitz\\'s wife role, and Walken\\'s J-Man -- all great stuff.  I can\\'t stand people that get on IMDb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one. I will take Envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year (save Napoleon Dynamite.) It\\'s wittier, wackier, and an offbeat, enjoyable gem.  Remember this people; Most times, Popular doesn\\'t equal Good.'\n",
      " b\"When The Spirits Within was released, all you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like Final Fantasy. This is a different story, for better or worse. The familiar settings, characters, music, story, and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. The problem is that it just isn't a good movie in its own right.  The direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy, switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic, but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing.  The CG itself is exceptional, but I can't say it's the best I've ever seen since Spirits Within had much more detail on the characters, although I must admit that Advent Children's characters moved much more naturally.  The plot is virtually a black hole. It's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring Sephiroth back for one last fight. Old characters reappear, but serve no real purpose other than to please fans. Character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game's end. But it's packed with neat-looking fight scenes with magic, summons, and limit breaks, which is probably what fans wanted anyway.  In the end, Advent Children is a very flashy, but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel.  By the way, don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting Not Useful. It just makes me feel superior knowing that fanboys/fangirls resent my objectivity so greatly.\"\n",
      " b'This is such a beautiful movie. I could go on and on about how good it is but I don;t want to bore anyone.   \"Splash\" is the story of a love between a new york Bachelor and a mermaid he meets in Cape Cod. She saves him from drowning and eventually meets up with him in the big apple. He doesn\\'t know she is a mermaid so basically the rest of the movie is about her trying to conceal the fact that she is not human,while they are in the meantime falling in love. Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, Eugene Levy and John Candy give fantastic performances and the New York images are just breathtaking:)  Katrina'\n",
      " b'The Best of Youth is a wonderfully scripted, acted, and visually stunning film that will sweep you off your feet and into the lives of an Italian family as they go through the trials and tribulations of life. The film\\'s main focus is on two brothers, Nicola and Matteo Catiti whose personalities are as different as night and day yet is also immediately apparent that these two love each other very much. Nicola is the younger, free spirited and philosophical brother while Matteo is more outspoken, with a hot temper and closed personality.  What I admired most throughout this film was the use and passage of time. Events in Italian history are not crammed into 120 minutes but is instead elongated, as Matteo and Nicola react in their own ways to the events that occur in their country. Time is such an important factor in this film, evidents not only by the six hour running time, but how those six hours are treated. Special occasions occur, yet none are given any special attention. The events that occur are important for that moment in time, yet one pass become mere memories such is the case of life.  With the passage of time, The Best Of Youth became such a moving experience for me. I felt as if I were a part of their family. I could not touch them, or talk to them, yet they seemed to welcome me with open arms as I silently watched their lives unfold before me. I could feel the love this family had for each other as I laughed and cried right beside them. Words just do not seem to be enough to describe the brilliance of this film. It is literally life transferred on screen.  The Best of Youth is remarkably acted and directed. At no time during this film was I bored, because such attention is made to character development, script, and cinematography. In the first part of the film, Nicola is exploring Norway, and sends a postcard to his brother back home telling him of his travels and experiences, and in three words, seems to sum up the film perfectly: \"Life is beautiful.\" After viewing this film, you will share the same perspective.  HIGHLY Recommended'\n",
      " b'  Everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors. That is to say that what might be number one priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company, may not be so for a great many other people, ordinary people. From the opening scene in which an Iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened, with the result the children are not impressed, as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in New York, USA, wherever that is, this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess.   Whereas, obviously, the attack on the WTC was a dastardly event by any yardstick, one does get the impression that both politicians and TV cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces. Would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on Lagos, say, or Djakarta, say, or even on Rio de Janeiro, say? I rather think not. News seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen: much more TV time is given to an earthquake in Italy, say, than one ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia, say. Greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster.   This series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective - or, perhaps I should say, some of the pieces do, as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story, his own translated perspective, such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits, but individually for each eleven-minute segment.   In no way should one deduce that this is an anti-American film: that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments. However, it is not pro-American either. The eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link - if there is one - is that the disaster of the WTC attack has to be seen in perspective from different view-points. Only then will such people as George Bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on.   Clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine I have been harbouring for two years now: America has not learnt the lesson. And the lesson is that the USA has to share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force. Instead of learning that the USA cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere, its political leaders, aided and abetted by Blair (and even Aznar) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant, which is not doing any good to anyone in Afghanistan or Irak at present, let alone much elsewhere. The White House mentality is totally rejectable: the US and UK invaded Irak and caused all the chaos, and so should clear up the mess they caused - not insist on the UN and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil.   Radical stances adopted by the US (or even Israel) is only going to be met by radical stances from Islamic people, who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism, if only to cover up their own macho uselessness, i.e., stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground.   The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture.'\n",
      " b'There is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.'\n",
      " b\"I have no idea why some of the reviews I've seen on both IMDb and netflix are positive to this movie. Perhaps it is because friends of the filmmaker wrote in. Because I can only use 1,000 words to denigrate this film, I will try to be curt: First, for this film to be effective on any level (comedy, social satire, politically, whatever) it would have to have some basis in truth. In other words, the filmmaker should have interviewed historians, sociologists, and other intellectuals who could have drawn some reasonable projection on what modern day America would have looked like had the south won the war.  The fact that the filmmaker concluded that there would have been one country was so ludicrous, he lost all credibility.  Therefore, the mock commercials that ran through this movie were not only unfunny - but totally stupid given that no reality had been adequately established in this movie.  The various vignettes (lincoln being a black-faced escapee) were dull, stupid, reaching and clearly designed for the filmmakers hopes of becoming a staff writer on SNL or Mad TV.  Spike Lee is a very talented filmmaker and should not be faulted for producing this movie. He probably had little involvement and was busy shooting his Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster film INSIDE MAN - a movie TOTALLY worth watching.  But this is simply tripe. Beware good reviews. They're probably friends of the filmmaker. This movie was not funny in the least, had no real insight to what ACTUALLY would have happened if the south won the war, and is a totally gigantic WHO CARES??????\"\n",
      " b'After receiving a DVD of this with a Sunday newspaper, I hoped that it was not the usual duff films that are given away because no one would ever buy them. I was wrong. Sheens acting is on par with that of a ten year old in a school pantomime production and the same goes for the majority of the cast. Neill is satisfactory, but plays a Russian and isn\\'t helped by his hybrid Northern Irish/New Zealand accent, and nor are the rest of the KGB characters, all of whom sound like they\\'re in a Cambridge Footlights reunion. In fact, the only people with genuine accents are extras who supply an odd word here and there, helpfully letting us know at least where the hell everything is going on in what is otherwise a complete mash. The \"espionage\" factor is unimpressive for the most part and primarily consists of Sheen faffing about in various ridiculous disguises whilst trying to blend into the background, quickly becoming not only boring but laughable. The plot has potential but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements. This could have been so much better.'\n",
      " b\"I would consider it a crime not to warn potential viewers that this is the worst of an extensive range of sci fi movies that I have ever seen.  Bad, doesn't even come close.  I do not think there is a single aspect of film-making that is not violated by this movie. Poor plot, corny lines, appalling music, and acting are backed up by technical handling that leaves home movies looking good. Of particular note are the special effects. Marvel at the simulations of infra-red and the dazzling array of weaponry that has been designed for the film.  I think that lastly, the cyborg deserves a special mention, for making me appreciate Schwarznegger's performance in Terminator 1. You would have thought bad acting was pretty close to a robot, but in this case it is more like the Village People.\"\n",
      " b\"*Possible Spoiler*  'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a useless movie. The acting was not good and the plot wasn't even remotely interesting.  'Cabin by the Lake' is a good TV movie. The sequel was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this. It seemed as if HE wasn't even interested in doing the sequel. His acting was good but it could have been better. I really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion, they're not even worth mentioning. But I'll do it. The character of Alison isn't even hardly shown in the first part of the film. All of a sudden she's the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role didn't make sense and it should have been thought out a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. Her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else, anybody else. The director, Mike, was a confusing character. He seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn't seem like his death was necessary. The acting for this role was good, nothing great but better than Salem's.  The plot was real lousy if you think about it. Stanley, who is presumed dead, makes his way onto the set of 'Cabin by the Lake', the movie based on his script. He stumbles upon the director and in a short time, the director is dead and Stanley is running the show. Yeah, out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him. There's some killings, not a whole lot, and the one's that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character gets chewed up by a motorboat. And one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning. These writers must have been hard up for excitement.  I just have to say that I was not impressed with the filming of the movie. The way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast. Also, the new cabin by the lake was poorly created. We aren't shown it but only in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more, but it didn't work in this one.  There were too many characters in this sequel. All of them except for a few had no reason to be there. The acting of what little is showed was really bad and...they just didn't have a purpose in this movie.  All in all, 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a sequel picking up from where the first left off. 'Cabin by the Lake' I can take but this was just not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this one and so should you. It's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second. Not to mention that the writing was horrible. Put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep.  So, we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well. By the way he talks, it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself. Quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright!  (Did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one? They were all done in a tank. Never, never reveal the secrets of filming.)  \"\n",

      " b'The movie is a total crap. We have two good actors who are miscast and a meat-head of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is a crap. The characters poorly sketched. Non existent story telling. No editing to speak of. Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star..that is a dream in itself. The movie drags along to the point of decadence. The whole charade about Arjun bringing his Manna to London, let him grope his girlfriend and let him not play at Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan\\'s over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this Producer Vipul Shah but this is not one of them. It seems all the good directors are falling prey to the Box Office mania..that the Mumbai Media Morons have created. This is yet another crap movie in the lines of \"Wanted\" with idiot actor like Salman Khan who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema. He is good to the Indian Cinema as Titanic was to the Winter Cruise Business. On a positive note-I like Asin character dancing Bharatnatyam when she changes to the Western style dancing when the teacher is not looking.'\n",
      " b\"The last couple of sneak previews brought films full of violence and so I was hoping for a change as I didn't want to leave the cinema in the middle of a film again. Although this film is very positive, I sometimes wished back to something more exciting. It seems to be a common misconception to believe that a life full of tragedy automatically turns into a good story. This film is the perfect proof for it. It swings back and forth between tragedy and bliss but there's no suspense. Even the tragedy is predictable and unavoidable. The conclusions that are drawn from all this are commonplace. Of course, from a personal, private perspective it's different but from the point of view of a film there's nothing in it. This makes me wonder why people seem to think that all this is more interesting if it happens in an exotic place. I guess many, many people have gone through all this and worse and no one seems to think it worthwhile telling a story about them. There's one good thing to be said about this film, however. It goes against the grain of modern film producing. It's quiet and the acting is toned down.\"\n",
      " b'This movie was terribly made. Of course, it was a little too much like Puppet Master, though the characters, I mean the dolls as characters were too much like Demonic Toys. Oh, what the heck, they are mixed up. Like I said, this was a terrible movie. The clown faced and the small-headed dude were kind of silly characters, now I know why small-headed dude wore a mask, because his head is too small. This movie does not deserve a sequel, at all. These characters should be in the Demonic Toys series. And where do they get the \"actors\" to make these movies? Are there that many persons working at odd jobs around the movie business...? to say nothing of the director, who also wrote this mess.'\n",
      " b'Fearless Freaks is the story of \"the punks finally taking acid\" featuring the alternative band, The Flaming Lips. It is a masterful explosion of bizarre rock & roll footage collaged into a documentary form. Each \\'Lip\\' goes into detail how they became part of the group and their personal struggles throughout their years. In a way, the film is a blueprint of how to become a rock star; make music with your friends, film every show, make loud experimental music, use smoke and fire when you lack talent, find a filmmaker to follow you around, crank call record companies, tour , tour , tour and you\\'ll finally make it big. Every Flaming Lip fan and starving rocker will appreciate this fiery saga. Freaks is filmed by their longtime director Brad Beesley(Okie Noodling). It looks deep into their origins in Oklahoma City and is culled from over 400 hours of video footage the \\'Lips\\' had in their archives of early shows, growing up, pictures and show posters. Beesley signed on to follow the band in the early 1990\\'s and made many of their early music videos. Produced by Minnesotans, Rick Fuller and edited by Jolynn Garnes.'\n",
      " b'\"Slam Dance\" is not a good picture. First of all it\\'s boring. Second it\\'s badly written and thirdly it\\'s badly directed.   Tom Hulce gives a very cheesy performance as a troubled cartoonist on the run. During an early scene he enters his burglarized apartment and reaches for an umbrella for protection. The ridiculous expression of satisfaction he gives at finding such a handy weapon is completely out of tune with the tension of the scene and so from that point on all credibility is lost. Surprisingly Tom Hulce has a few more moments of uncertainty as an actor during the course of this rambling movie. The blame must rest firmly on the director shoulders.  There are also a myriad of corny coincidences and gaping loopholes that only serve to alienate the viewer. Such simple logic as to how a casually dressed man on the run can enter an evening dress society Hollywood party with out the hint problem is tossed aside as unimportant.   Just because children seem to like the lead protagonist does not automatically mean the audience will. Who is this cartoonist that laughs at his own jokes?   This is a motion picture that can degrade in the studio vaults to its hearts content because it will never be missed.'\n",
      " b\"Being a history buff, I rented this movie because of the subject matter. The idea of the Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat. Much of the story is simply boring; nothing much happens for long stretches. The director uses goofy imagery (offered up in the form of daydream sequences) in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial pacing, but instead, it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie. The characters are also poorly drawn. In the end, we don't really care as much about them as we should. It's a shame that this wasn't what it could have been. I would still like to see a good movie about the American immigrant experience, but this one isn't it.\"\n",

      " b'While in Salvador, Brazil, in a medical congress, the researcher of Alzheimer Dr. Taylor Briggs (Billy Zane) and his colleague and friend Dr. Deepra Chang (Terry Chen) are invited to visit a local hospital. They find a patient from Amazon with a unique case of tumors in the memory cells, and while examining him, the glove of Taylor ruptures and his finger touches a strange powder. Taylor has visions from 1971, and once back to Boston, he finds that he has genetically stored memories of a serial killer of little girls activated by the powder.   \"Memory\" is a messy and absurd thriller. I was attracted by the cast, with Dennis Hopper, Ann-Margret and Billy Zane, but I in the end I was absolutely disappointed with the coincidences and the insane and totally unbelievable story. For Brazilians, it is hilariously ridiculous the geographic confusion of the screenplay, with a sick patient coming from Amazon to Salvador (why?); Taylor and Deepra are in a congress in Salvador (there is a footage of the city), they go to a bar and the director uses footage of the front of \"Barril 1800\", in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro instead of a local bar; the interior of the bar is probably in a studio. My vote is four.  Title (Brazil): \"Alucina\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xb5es\" (\"Hallucinations\")'\n",
      " b'I like the phrase \"British post war suburban paranoia\" that one of the reviewers used. It describes so well the kind of films John Mills excelled in (\"The October Man\" (1947), \"The Long Memory\" (1952)) in between \"big\" pictures (\"Scott of the Antartic\" (1948) and \"War and Peace\" (1956)).  This distinctly \"Eric Ambler\" style plot had John Mills playing Dr. Howard Latimer, who promises his friend, Charles, (unseen) to meet a visiting German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at the airport. A creepy \"reporter\" Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries) is in his consulting rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down Windsor informs him she is already in the car waiting!!! (something fishy is going on!!!). Howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it.  The next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work, further more, he finds his friend Charles could not have rung him as he is still in New York and Windsor doesn\\'t seem to exist. Earlier on a patient, Mrs Ambler(Rene Ray) who has been referred to him by Doctor George Kimber (Mervyn Johns) tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a brass candlestick with a square base. It is a nightmare that is coming true for Howard but of course when Detective Inspector Dane (Roland Culver) interviews her, she denies all knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick is later found in the boot of Howard\\'s Daimler.  When Howard is lying low, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself a \"friend\" - he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches Frieda gave Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the flat, Charles rings and while Howard is on the phone an unknown assailant knocks him out and steals the matches!!! Who can he trust - who hasn\\'t something to hide!!!  This is a top thriller - not quite in the same class as \"The October Man\", but with John Mills doing what he does best - playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries!!!  Highly Recommended.'\n",
      " b\"I am a new convert you might as well say. I borrowed the dvds from my local library. I have been interested in samurai since watching 'The Last Samurai.' My dad told me he used to watch Shintaro when he was a kid. He said that it was pretty good. We are up to series 3. I absolutely love it. It takes a little to get used to the dubbed English voices over the characters speaking Japanese but I really enjoy it all the same. It is a little strange to watch the slight pauses when the ninja stars are thrown at characters and they stick into a tree or wall. I was not used to this but I am now. But I suppose that's the technology they had in the 60s. I've noticed that Shintaro is kind, friendly, willing to help those in need, he's very humble, most of the time he doesn't big note himself (he only says he is better than the enemy ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It's really interesting to watch the swordsmanship that Koichi Ose has. It is amazing. This series is for anyone who are interested in samurai.\"\n",
      " b\"Young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. Barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame good cops. Again, how many times? There was not an original shred in this entire concoction. Giovanni Ribisi made a valiant effort to prop up the lack of script, drawing the only laughs of the entire movie. And the thought of he and Claire Danes working from a real script with a grown-up director and photographed by an actual cinematographer intrigues me. Note to screenwriters: Buy one of those story generators. It can't possibly be as bad as ripping off bad television. Note to auteur: There are shots available to you other than closeups. Even the lovely and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually grows tiresome in closeup. Note to cinematographer: Apprentice yourself to a professional for a few years--you have much to learn. Note to color timer at the lab: At least try to persuade the auteur and the cinematographer that they don't know what they're talking about. Note to Claire: I hope this paid for your new condo. It's time to get some professional management and start actually reading the scripts before signing on.\"\n",
      " b'The reason I am reviewing this is that the previous review, was written by someone who walked out of this film, not even half way through. Unfortunately for him, he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty. Agreed the film was very slow to start, in fact the friend I was with fell asleep briefly,I woke him before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience. Thankfully the film developed from there into a story of love, drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental 60s. Fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel. Be patient, like many great films its well worth the wait, and is certainly a film that I will look forward to revisiting! 8/10'\n",
      " b'Takashi Shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film Ju-On The Grudge. While I haven\\'t seen that film, I would have to wager that there\\'s more imagination and originality (or some rip-off originality, in other words skill with known tropes of the Japanese ghost movie) than in his own directed remake. Maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal, or I would guess accessibility, for an American audience. What starts off with some potential - the hint of something very screwed up going on with Bill Pullman\\'s sudden movement - just goes into a total jumble. And as a horror movie? Gimme a break.  Tension could have been built on the situation - a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted - but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel. Scares? How\\'s about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something. A black cat? Yeah, why not just make the ghost-boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which, in effect, is only creepy if you want cats. Plot? Why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told (meaning, while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall, they aren\\'t), or for that matter have us care about ANYONE in the cast.  By the time the characters, or those that are there for exposition, get around to telling us what is going on or whatever, there\\'s little point to care. The film-making is shoddy (i.e. the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way), and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked (Gellar especially is disappointing, but Pullman, who shows up later after his first scene, is sorely miscast). Even when Shimizu tries for some average old \"Boo\" scares, like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the Grudge ghost, it\\'s still silly. Just watch when she\\'s going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots. Either you\\'ll go with it, and if so more power to you, or you\\'ll laugh hysterically at the results. Count me in the latter.  I\\'m not totally sure where this project went wrong - was it Shimizu having to retool it for the studios, or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision? Or maybe Raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing and/or dull than they would be with someone else. The Grudge gives us a lot of information that doesn\\'t make sense or at the least give us some horror-fodder to chew on. It\\'s cineplex trash of a sad order.'\n",

Well done to Mel Brooks for producing such a beautiful film and having faith in the then relatively unheard of David Lynch.

The characters are very well developed; however, the story is dated and there is a weird and unexplained situation, when Sister Edit tells that she loves David Holm. Why should a enlightened woman love such a despicable man that wasted his life corrupting other people? Despite being religiously dated in the present days, it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption in the end. My vote is nine.

      " b\"I found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so I have decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets RIGHT are what make it worthwhile. It doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. It is worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good. The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, what's not to like? Besides, name another film in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life?\"\n",

So taken with it, I corresponded with Mr. Rathbun, then president of Standard Oil, which sponsored the presentation on PBS. He sent me a photo of the tapestry (actually a charcoal rendering) used behind the credits.  To the opening theme music of Bayco\\'s \"Elizabethan Masque,\" my family and I gathered around our black & white TV to drink in Shakespeare\\'s words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players (at least to American audiences at the time).  We were introduced to such actors as Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have continued to enjoy their accomplishments ever since. One of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued to age in their respective roles as Shakespeare\\'s \"King\" plays were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order.  I wish I could tell those actors just how much that series meant to me.  If \"Age of Kings\" could be revived on VHS and/or DVD, it would so please those of us who long to see it again and those who missed it the first time around.  GOOD NEWS! PBS HAS JUST ISSUED A DVD OF \"AN AGE OF KINGS\"! SEE THEIR JULY 2009 CATALOG, PAGE 19, OR CALL THEM TOLL FREE. I JUST ORDERED MINE!'\n",

When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.  The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism. I am glad these films are still around for the next generation. I hope I never out grow the magic of the muppets.'\n",

I appreciate that the filmmakers want to make a fun movie, but to do a scene that reminds the viewer of the Keystone Cops is off the mark.  Richard Pryor. Great actor. Great comedian. Poor choice. But I guess it\\'s not his fault. The premise of the movie itself was silly. But I love Richard. (God rest his soul...)

Ummm...didn\\'t he just send a nuclear elevator from Paris into space a few years back? Get real!   Lana\\'s son...Tommy or Timmy or whatever. What an annoying little kid. He deserves to get beat up.  Special effects. Did they fire the SFX people from the first two movies and hire some graduate of Devry? No offense Devry...  Aghghhh!!!

      " b'Did I miss something? Was there a contest going through all the Grade Schools of America to find the best story for acclaimed director Bret Ratner to bring to the silver screen? If so, why wasn\\'t there a calendar made for those who didn\\'t make the final cut? Oh, wait, apparently children did not write this film, but instead a guy that wrote for the TELEVISION SERIES the Weakest Link. That surely makes him ready by all means to tackle the caper genre and inherit a big payday \\xc2\\x85 right? You are the weakest link \\xc2\\x85 good-bye. This movie was a disaster from the beginning. With cardboard acting, an aging (and girth growing) sex symbol, and a corny ending that incorporated nothing that we were shown through the entire film, it is a big wonder how After the Sunset ever saw the illustrious \"green-light\". Perhaps it was the size of Salma\\'s boo \\xc2\\x85 name, or perhaps the fact that Pierce Brosnan\\'s The Thomas Crown Affair was such a cult film, or maybe because Don Cheadle was in it, because it had really no pull with just Woody headlining. So, how did this film get made? This film targeted pre-teen boys and retirement communities, and with their great pull, the financing behind this film became very easy.  This was a caper film right? We are supposed to go on this roller coaster ride of who\\'s conning whom, coupled with lies, deceit, and a surprise ending that will make you want to re-watch from the beginning to experience anything that you missed. That is the focus, goal, and overall tone that a film like this should have followed. Instead, Ratner decided to just make a movie without any sort of excitement or drive. As I watched this film, I never once felt excited about the plot. Why? Because there was nobody getting me excited. The acting in this film was well below par for anything that Hollywood has released. Pierce tries, but just can\\'t seem to capture the essence of the film. There is no little demon inside you rooting for anything. Salma\\'s role was basically for eye-candy. She provided nothing spectacular either. I can literally say the same for Woody and Cheadle as well. Here we have strong actors doing absolutely nothing during the course of about two hours. These characters never drive the plot, they bring nothing but clich\\xc3\\xa9s to the table, and by the end we really don\\'t have any true grasp as to whom they are. Honestly, cardboard cutouts could have replaced the actual actors and After the Sunset would have been a better film. There was no depth to the characters, no emotion, no structure, just the simple direction of \"step here, say your line, step here, look surprised\". It was embarrassing for all that were involved.  I think a major flaw to this film was that Ratner did not fully understand, or was prepared, for the caper genre. From the opening moments until the end of the film, you can tell that Ratner is just trying to use his friends in the industry and show the world that he has some power as well. I say this because I saw no true direction or moment of impressiveness where he defines himself as a director. He reuses the same ideas throughout the entire film, he doesn\\'t give anything strong to his players, and nothing stood out in this movie. Sure, it was a beautiful location, but am I to believe that Salma spend a majority of the film building a deck for them to sit on? Am I to believe that Pierce is still a sex symbol even with a HUGE gut sticking out? Am I to believe that Cheadle is a bad guy/imported American who is at the top of the community? Finally, am I to believe that Pierce could still move as quickly as Ratner defined? I swear that in the final unclimactic moments of this film, I could hear Pierce doing some heavy breathing to get from point A to point B. Maybe he isn\\'t ready for the next Bond role.  So, without a good story, or decent characters, maybe there was some humor in it that could pull us away from the sour sensation cultivating in your mouth. Well, guess who is placed in to do the humor element? Woody Harrelson. Now, I don\\'t mind Woody, but in this role, he just wasn\\'t believable and his humor was so clich\\xc3\\xa9 that I had trouble believing that he brought anything to this character. He literally plagiarized his entire role. Teachers, and film viewers of the world, should be very upset with him. Instead of bringing a new twist to his character, he resorted to weird sex humor, skimpy bully humor, and that ever-popular drunken humor while fishing that is sure to make that senile woman in the front burst out with laughter. To me it was pathetic and a worthless attempt to make a joke out of already dead film.  Overall, this was a massive disappointment. Here you had a decent director, some strong players, but the worst story ever written by a man who wrote for a game show. Which piece does not fit? There was this huge sense of apathy throughout this entire film and clich\\xc3\\xa9s riddled it that I just couldn\\'t get past. Brosnan had trouble with this film, and I couldn\\'t tell if it was because he just didn\\'t care, or because he was working with such low-talent that his heart just wasn\\'t in it. The ending hurt as well. There was no excitement or intensity, just plain \\xc2\\x85 \"here it is \\xc2\\x85 like it or not\". I personally couldn\\'t digest this film with its poor acting and below-par story. This may be a good film for some that are not familiar with the caper genre, but for me it was just hogwash.

      " b'The best part of this movie, is Milla\\'s backside.  The movie starts with a premise that Samuel\\'s character is out looking for a runaway girl. That disappears. Then, the antagonist gang takes him hostage, well, sort of. No real reason to do this, other than that they think they\\'ve been discovered. But, from there, it\\'s all lost. Samuel L. Jackson is the protagonist, but he\\'s tied to a chair for 2/3\\'s of the movie!  Then there\\'s the absurd robbery by an apparently blind man (in clear glasses, so you can see his eyes move and react), and his cohort, and evil little blonde-haired troll, who\\'s NEVER accosted, not once, while walking directly into the power room of the bank. He\\'s able to amazingly hack into the bank\\'s computers, and shut the power off to the whole building. Somehow, I think that ALL transactions would be off, regardless of the circumstances at that point - but maybe that\\'s just me. Then, there\\'s the wimpy banker that just HAS to get his rocks off BEFORE they flee the country, and the little wa***r troll that\\'s too stupid to realize that he shouldn\\'t kill the only man who knows the all-important \"password\", and the account information is stored on a 3.5 inch disk, right (dated technology there, why not on a reel tape?). They whiz through banks at a breakneck pace, withdrawing large sums of money, without so much as a batting of the eye. I\\'m not even going to get into Samuel and Milla\\'s musical interlude while she has him untied. Mr. officer, I think, might have had a trick up his sleeve to elude her and get out of the house at that point.  Bad movie, bad plot, bad characters, the kind of movie that\\'s 97 minutes long and you\\'d swear you\\'ve been watching it for 4 hours. Terrible.'\n",

      " b\"'No Good Deed' as the DVD of the film was titled here is an average adaptation of a short story of the 'noire' classic Dashiel Hammet. It is not a coincidence that many of the clichees of the genre are repeated here - the platinate blonde, the sophisticated evil criminals, the good old lady who is not really who she seems to be, etc. The crime part of the story is not very catching, and the really interesting part if the zig-zag the main female character is doing between the different men in the story. Milla Jovovitch is very good in this film, reminding me the role Kim Bassinger got an Oscar for. Also there are quite a lot of mis-matches and not everything makes perfect sense in the plot, the result is over all an agreeable mix, and a fair entertainment. 7/10 on my personal scale.\"\n",

I am further shocked that the people who are so quick to disregard even an ounce of this information haven\\'t even bothered to research \"the lies\" even a little. If even 1/3 of what is said in the movie is true, isn\\'t that enough to further investigate?'\n",
      " b'Hey now, yours truly, TheatreX, found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a \"cult hit\" so of course it came home with me.   What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway, this is one strange pair, Big Edie and Little Edie...Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings, and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother, age 79) apparently likes to run around naked, and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where we\\'re mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it doesn\\'t make a whole lot of sense, except to them. They live in absolute filth, cats doing their business wherever (\"Look, that cat\\'s going to the bathroom behind my portrait!\"), and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie\\'s voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt, who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as \"eccentric\", and I\\'d have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for \"wacked out of their gourds\", but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them. This is equal parts creepy, sad, and disgusting, but I couldn\\'t stop watching once I started. This is not my \"normal\" type of flick but I found it to be somewhat fascinating. It won\\'t be for everybody though, guaranteed.'\n",
      " b\"As in unbelievably bad, that is.  To a reviewer who called it superb, the director owes you big time,as he has at least one (and probably only) fan of his film.  Boring, slow and 90 minutes longer than it should've been, this movie gives nothing but painful shivers.  And, after the end credits finish, the main question persists: What on earth was it all about? Even though I haven't had a pleasure of being introduced to Mr. Paez's music, I am absolutely positive he is a great composer. But let's face the truth...Neither Mozart nor Bethoeven tried to make their living as painters....With all my respect, Mr. Paez, I hope you get my hint.\"\n",
      " b\"The Sopranos is perhaps the most mind-opening series you could possibly ever want to watch. It's smart, it's quirky, it's funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can't resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters, set in the subterranean world of the New York crime families. For most of the time, you really don't know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back, or buy them lunch.   Further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - These are dangerous men, most of them murderers, but by God if you don't love them too. I've laughed at their wisecracks, been torn when they've made err in judgement, and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal.   The suburban setting of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for this show's subtext - people aren't always as they seem, and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds.   If you haven't already, you most definitely should.\"\n",
      " b\"Long available in incomplete or full screen editions, Abel Ferrara's 1979 cult classic THE DRILLER KILLLER here receives its definitive presentation, accompanied by three of the director's never-previously-released short films from the 1970s. THE DRILLER KILLER stars Ferrara himself (under the pseudonym 'Jimmy Laine') as Reno Miller, an artist being driven mad by the pressures of New York life who takes to the streets and begins murdering derelicts with a power drill. Although Ferrara intended to make a film in the tradition of THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, the end result bore an even greater resemblance to Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER. THE DRILLER KILLER is an indispensable addition to the collection of anyone interested in 1970s horror, the work of Abel Ferrara, or off-the-wall cinema.\"\n",
      " b\"That Certain Thing is the story of a gold digger (Viola Dana) from a tenement house. Her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers, but they are a loving family. Although Dana's character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor, she refuses and holds out for a millionaire. Everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy, but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire, son of the owner of the popular ABC restaurant chain. The two marry hastily, but the girl's dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger. However, she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own.  A rare glimpse of movie star Viola Dana, this film is a lot of fun. Dana's role is accessible, natural, and entertaining. She displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama.  The mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too. The camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility. The title cards are also incredibly clever.  If you like films like My Best Girl, It, or The Patsy, you will enjoy this film.\"\n",
      " b'A very good movie! First, the plot listed is incorrect. He does not escape from a prison in Alabama, but rather the state prison in Huntsville, Texas, (the author apparently got their \"Huntsvilles\" mixed up and assumed it was Alabama.) There is, in fact, a prison in Huntsville, TX, and the entire movie takes place in Texas & Mexico. A lot of action, albeit, the plot\\'s outcome is apparent throughout. Still, this movie has an outstanding cast for a low-budget film and the original music by John Schneider is excellent. I would definitely recommend this to any fan of Kirk Douglas, John Schneider, or just your average action-movie-without-all-the-big-time-Hollywood-promotion stuff. I would say it is along the lines of movies such as \"Lone Wolf McQuade\", \"Hunter\\'s Blood\", or \"Avenging Force\", all great movies without a lot of hype!'\n",
      " b'\"A Dirty Shame\" is a John Waters film about a prudish, uptight mid-western woman who, after having concussion in a motor vehicle accident, becomes a raving sex addict.  Although I\\'m a bit of a John Waters fan - \"A Dirty Shame\" was a pretty big shame and a disappointment.  I guess society and comedy has moved on a bit from drag queens eating doggie-do (see Pink Flamingos). Shows and films like South Park, Wonder Showzen and Team America seem to push the envelope in terms of bad taste comedy. \"A Dirty Shame\" just seems to fall a little short of that \"pushing the envelope in bad taste\" name.  Most of the sexual discussion feels not quite as raunchy as \"Sex in the City\" or even \"Jerry Springer\"!! Most things about this movie feels a little on the amateurish side - the acting, the cinematography, the script... However - one plus was the Selma Blair character - although it sort of felt it was a little underused.  Overall - A Dirty Shame was a big disappointment. John Waters appears not to be pushing that \"bad taste\" envelope anymore. Perhaps he needs to return to more kitsch mainstream territory (a la Hairspray).'\n",
      " b'Anyone who thought exploitation movies were invented in the 1960s will know better after having watched Night Nurse. It\\'s a strange mix of comedy, drama and mild sleaze. The story is pretty weak but for fans of Barbara Stanwyck this is an absolute must see. Her performance is very energetic (aggressively shoving her face very close to that of other people, punching big guys, hurtling bottles of champagne around etc.) and she really comes through as a sensuous \\xc2\\x96 albeit tough as nails - nurse. For some time she must wear a tiny band aid on her chin which makes her even more attractive. Joan Blondell is also great as her gum chewing friend, setting the standard for vulgarity. The movie basically deals with the ethics of the medical profession which is treated with amazing cynicism.   The highlight for me was the conversation between the excited Stanwyck character and an older Pappy-type doctor. The nurse suspects foul play in a particular medical case and Pappy tries to calm her down with sensible arguments. The nurse quickly loses her patience and her temper, shouting. \\xc2\\x84Aw, ethics, ethics, ethics! I\\'m through with ethics!\" It\\'s really a well played scene which brings the character and temperament of the nurse to the fore and reflects the atmosphere of the whole movie. I also liked the unethical doctor with his facial twist and snazzy uniform which must have influenced people who created the wardrobe for Starship Enterprise. His big office has very elegant Art Deco trappings and is in stark contrast to the rather cramped conditions in the ethically operated hospital shown in this movie.'\n",
      " b'Allow me to start this review by saying this: I love vampire movies. They can suck (har har pun intended), and I\\'ll still love them because vampires are just cool in movies. Van Helsing, considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap, was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires. You may ask: \"What does that have to do with this movie?\" The answer is that I intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is, that even a sucker (harharhar) for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so much.  The movie stars Van Helsing, a college professor guy who isn\\'t at all convincing. He\\'s a terrible actor, like everyone else in this movie, and he wrote it, to add salt to the wound. I honestly to not mean to offend him, and I\\'m sure everyone had fun making this movie, but watching it was actually painful. I\\'m not sure why I watched the whole thing; perhaps it was a morbid fascination, like watching an impending train crash: it\\'s horrible, but you can\\'t manage to force yourself to look away. Its main fault is that it\\'s just so ****ing boring, and its plot is so damn ridiculous, even for a science fiction horror movie.  But, I digress. By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mom. Of course, he doesn\\'t know it\\'s her at the time; he just thinks it\\'s one of his students (which is still illegal and all, but not as disgusting and creepy).  If I were Van Helsing, I would at least pull an Oedipus myself when I found out I had done something so gross. It would\\'ve made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it, but no. The point isn\\'t even brought up at all, by any of the characters. It\\'s as if the writer didn\\'t even think of it. I would\\'ve at least had another character laugh at him and say \"Ha ha, you had sex with your mom,\" which would be mildly humorous (although blatantly immature). I\\'m probably running out of room, so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this film: there\\'s a vampire ninja fight with an old man. It would be funny, but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. It\\'s not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is. Stay far, far away from it if you value your time at all.  I will say one thing positive about the movie: the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his. There\\'s like, a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks. It would be boring in any other movie, but here, sadly, it was the highlight.'\n",
      " b\"More nonsense from pap-Maestro director Kevin Sullivan. Another Cordon Bleu of racially motivated comedy designed to suck the dollars from a dumbed-down middle America. The clich\\xc3\\xa9 of the Oedipally challenged father refusing to relinquish his jilted grip on his daughter is far from a stranger to our screens. A successful director's job these days seems simply to be that of taking an already burned out concept, removing all intelligible plot moments, merging in a few racially 'hip' moments and then repeat until they have enough money to breed and make more of these sordid offerings. The 'comdedic' castration scene alone should be enough to silence this director's career forever. Nonetheless in addition the scene when the delusional father starts physically befouling the prospective stud's mattress in an attempt to quite literally dirty him in his fianc\\xc3\\xa9e's eyes is perhaps one of the lowest points of cinema in the last hundred years. A degrading attempt at comedy, at best a cringing wallet filler for the director. All I can say is that I hope his daughter turns into a transsexual mud-wrestler and elopes with an incontinent zebra.\"\n",
      " b\"I'm sure this was a better movie in its native language but when dubbed in English it's impossible to understand. Either it's very abstract or the director and all the actors are completely stoned out of their minds, the movie is like a neverending seizure with cuts every two seconds and a poorly explained story involving (from what I can discern) crazy Russian vampires and some epic struggle between light and dark...  I watched this at night with a good friend who was equally unimpressed, and we still have no idea what this movie is about. The whole time I just wanted it to end. Please never watch this, I actually consider this the worst movie ever made.  Unbearable. 1/10\"\n",
      " b'Ten Inch Hero was like opening a present from your grandmother: like discovering that she got you an iPhone instead of the black socks you had prepared yourself to smile and be grateful for. In reality, that\\'s exactly what this movie turned out to be - an unexpected surprise and a truly uplifting story - when realistically, the average viewer would have just been satisfied to ogle Jensen Ackles sporting a mohawk.  The story of Ten Inch Hero, written by Betsy Morris and directed by David Mackay, is told through the genuine and poignant interweaving accounts of an unlikely group of friends. Set in a sandwich deli in Santa Cruz, the plot follows the lives of the off-beat employees as friendships are created and relationships are formed, damaged, then repaired. The focus of the movie rests mainly on four young characters: a young artist searching for her estranged daughter, a brunette temptress sleeping her way through California one man at a time, the quiet and reserved humanitarian looking for romance on the \\'net, and last but certainly not least, the quirky but sensitive punk rocker searching for love and acceptance.  Elizabeth Harnois gives an exceptional breakout performance as Piper, the artistic neophyte who introduces our \\'Heroes\\' when she stumbles across the eccentric hippy-run diner and applies for a job on the spot, told \"normal people need not apply\". Harnois\\' role as a confused young mother searching for the daughter she gave up for adoption at the tender age of fifteen is heart-warming and emotional as she faces her fears and is rewarded in ways she never expected.  Also new to the silver screen, Danneel Harris is amusingly wanton as the brunette bombshell, enticing the men of Santa Cruz to the buy sandwiches by the inch with a come-hither smile and unbearably cheesy pick up lines. Harris makes what could be a predictable character surprisingly dynamic as her relationships with her friends deepen and help her to grow, and eventually, realize her full potential.  As Jen, the kind-hearted computer geek, Clea Duvall\\'s performance is moving and surprisingly real. Jen is the quiet, saintly one of the boisterous group, known for giving hand outs to the homeless people of the community. Jen\\'s transformation happens slowly throughout the movie, as she steps out from her sanctuary behind the computer screen to meet her potential true love, a man she has never met outside of a chat room.  Finally, Jensen Ackles as hilariously witty and enigmatic Priestly is even more charming and adorable than expected, and well worth the wait. With a different wonderfully weird hairdo and hilariously outragious t-shirt in every scene, Ackles brings a deadly combination of sensitivity and hilarity to the character, leading up to a delightfully romantic ending that is sure to leave every woman in the theatre staring up at the screen in love-struck awe.  Even without a star-studded cast (or anything remotely close), Ten Inch Hero is a diamond in the rough. The quality of acting comes as a welcome surprise, and the story has the audience roaring with laughter one moment and close to tears the next. Whether it turns out to be a sleeper \\'hit\\' or not, Ten Inch Hero is unexpectedly gratifying and extremely entertaining, sure to leave a smile on the face of just about anyone who is lucky enough to see it.'\n",

Dr. Jason is hired by an agency to develop some kind of experience with DNA. What he does not know is that this DNA belongs to the body of a very developed prehistoric man, and his findings are being used by another government laboratory to develop a kind of super-intelligent species. His brother Andy is used as part of this experiment. This movie seems to be a bad pilot of a possible television series. However, the screenplay and the performance of the casting are so foolish that probably the producers gave up with such an investment. However, although deserving a place among the worst 250 films in IMDB, there are movies worst than that. By comparison with other craps, my vote is four.'\n",
      " b\"There is no doubt about it, but when Hollywood decides to make a cinematic masterpiece, and at the same time draws upon indigenous American social and cultural mores, as exemplified by a writer of the talent of Carson McCullers, the result can be both breath-taking and almost overwhelming. It is partly their very `Americaness' that makes films like THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER so unique and special to someone like myself who is not American. And this film in particular shows a side of the American psyche which is all too often neglected and unacknowledged in movies. The novel on which it is based is, sadly perhaps, too complex and long to adapt to the screen without sacrificing some aspect of the many subplots it contains, and although I regret the loss of the radical political dimension, the subtle and heart-wrenching way loneliness, racism, impoverishment, snobbery, and disadvantage are conveyed are so powerfully treated that the end result is a film of almost unbearable sadness and melancholy... and yet... And yet there is an element of tremendous hope also at work; of the human spirit overcoming huge odds and learning life's lessons as the various characters go along and work out their individual destinies. Superb ensemble acting from all concerned, and technical credits of the highest order make this one of the most deeply satisfying films I have ever seen in my life. A masterpiece, and one that could only have been made in the USA.\"\n",

The plot is so ridiculous I won\\'t even get into it--you can read the plot synopsis on the title page of this \"movie\".

The high points: there aren\\'t any.  Avoid at ALL costs!!!'\n",
      " b'The best thing about this film is Aaron Webber\\'s portrayal of 13-year-old Emerson. I\\'d recommend keeping an eye on his career in the future.   I found it preposterous that a lad of 13 would desire his teacher. Could someone please explain to me what is appealing about this older man - as far as I can tell, nothing. If the teacher were younger and better looking and the student 16 instead of 13, this movie might be believable. It is hard to get into a movie that is implausible out of the starting gate.  Canadians take pride in their movies because they are often freer and more daring than films made in the U.S.A. But one can be simply sordid and pointless instead of courageous and honest. The film-maker should do something with this greater freedom - not proclaim it for its own sake.  For all its supposed bravery, this movie is surprisingly conventional with regard to its depiction of the human body: The female lead is shown fully and plainly nude, whereas the father and the son are ever so carefully posed to avoid equivalent frankness. How traditionally sexist.  In \"Whole New Thing,\" the viewer is presumably \"liberated\" from hackneyed, conservative American stereotypes. But let\\'s take a closer look at the characters here: In place of sexually crimped, over-zealously religious parents trying to retard the sensuality of their teenage children we get a careworn, pot-smoking couple - a withdrawn, tepid man and his sad, adulterous wife; in place of a restless, dutiful youth shackled by legalistic restrictions on his behavior we get a kid who has no trouble lying about his intentions because he believes the lie will help him manipulate a much older man into having sex with him; and instead of an uninspired teacher limited by narrow, parochial thinking we get a guy who thinks it\\'s perfectly acceptable to cruise for casual sex at a rest stop. Are any of these free-wheeling replacements an improvement over their safer, more traditionally drawn counterparts? Is the indignant radical\\'s cry really, \"Liberate me so I can be sordid and miserable!\"?  There are seeds of a high-quality, courageous film in \"Whole New Thing,\" but they are never watered or cultivated. For example, there is a passably good-looking kid who harasses Emerson verbally and physically at school. At one point, Emerson asks him, \"What is it you want?\" But what if the film-makers with their Canadian courage explored the psychology of the bullying? What if Emerson punched back with gusto, held his own in a fistfight and then asked the question: \"What is it you want?\" What if the bully desired Emerson? (This is certainly more plausible - not to mention more innocent and age appropriate - than Emerson desiring his teacher.) How would such a relationship develop? Would they try to date? Would they meet secretly? How would the relationship affect the other kids in the school? The film might even flash forward to a committed, long-term relationship when the boys are older. Surely this would have been more interesting and daring than the somber radicals we\\'re presented with in this movie.'\n",
      " b'Based on an actual story, John Boorman shows the struggle of an American doctor, whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss. A holiday to Burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all, but when her passport was stolen in Rangoon, she could not leave the country with her sister, and was forced to stay back until she could get I.D. papers from the American embassy. To fill in a day before she could fly out, she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide. \"I tried finding something in those stone statues, but nothing stirred in me. I was stone myself.\"   Suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt. Just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train, she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot. In a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him, with no thought of herself. Continually her life was in danger.   Here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous, selfless charity, risking her life to save another. Patricia Arquette is beautiful, and not just to look at; she has a beautiful heart. This is an unforgettable story.   \"We are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps.\"'\n",

Yeah, it's got more lapses in logic than I care to describe here and might tax the patience of people - like myself, I have to admit - who are inclined to throw things at the TV on occasion, but it's funny at least. Just because it's not always INTENTIONALLY funny, there's no need to let that get you down.  However, if you've read the book - or any of the other books by Brookmyre - then you'd probably best avoid it. I've read them all and when I first watched this film, I despised it. I've trashed it in detail and at great length on another site, in fact. The TV plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful (and admittedly rabid) Brookmyre fans.  Best bit of advice..? Watch this, then read the book and only THEN make your comparisons and submit your judgement.\"\n",

The cinematography was interesting, and the camera was really shaky at times. However, due to the fact that it was filmed in 8 days, I do give them props.  One more thing, the movie tends to drop focus points...and has minimal dialogue.'\n",
      " b\"O.K. is the only possible way of analyzing this movie. It does what it set out to do. But if you have seen this movie and were disapointed, did you really think it was going to be as funny or enjoyable as earlier entries in the Pink Panther series? The movie's comedy is very lukewarm. Whether this is the fault of Blake Edwards, or maybe he intended it to be that way is unknown. Roberto Benigni is the Son. O.K, he is now an academy award winner, but in 1993 a complete unknown. If anyone on the movie wanted it to be a success then a bigger name should have been chosen, a David Jason, Dudley Moore or Rowan Atkinson. Benigni, does quite a good impersonation of Peter Sellers throughout the movie, but this aside isn't very funny or charming. The return of cast members like Herbert Lom, Graham Starke, Burt Kwouk and Liz Smith is good. But overall the movie seems forced and is something of a hit and miss. Lets hope the upcoming Mike Myers remake breathes new life into this series.\"\n",
      " b'This is one of the best films i have ever seen... I recommend it to anyone. Never before have I ever been put on such a roller-coaster of emotion from mind-blowingly intense scenes to scenes which make me feel sick. Scenes that make me laugh and scenes which make me want to punch something. Rhys Wakefield portrays an adolescent teen amazingly. Which I found surprising looking at some of the acting skills from his fellow Home and Away actors (see Xavier in H&A, WHY IS HE THERE???).   I saw the trailer and am a big fan of Toni Collette so decided to rent the film and was interested to see Rhys play a central character. The quality of directing took my breath away and I congratulate anyone involved in the production. I bought it straight away after renting and have watched it at least 5 times all with different people to show them one of the best films EVER MADE.'\n",
      " b\"SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I watched half of this movie and I didn't like it.   First reason: Boring. Barely anything happens, the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke weed, read magazines, care for their sick friend, and cut up the occasional dead body. BORING!!!!  Second reason: There are too many things left unexplained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, restrains them in a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters? Why does he kill one and let another one go?  Also there is this dude who at first I thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he's not quite what we originally thought-never explained! How frustrating is that?   Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the duologue tedious, and the action non-existent. Also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isn't. I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website, and although I respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick, I will from now on make sure I read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie I regret seeing.\"\n",
      " b'Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. He only directed 2 and \"Black Gold\" was one, (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence but in this he was playing a good kid. He was obviously quite popular on the \"quickie\" circuit - he made so many films. In this one he plays the son of an old oil rigger who is convinced that he will strike oil very soon.  J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell up as he knows there is going to be oil struck at any moment. A geologist, Henry, comes on the scene and helps \"Fishtail\\'s\" dad. He also convinces \"Fishtail\" to go to school regularly. Henry has his eye on Cynthia, the pretty teacher. This was Gloria Shea\\'s last film - she had begun her career as Olive Shea in \"Glorifying the American Girl\" (1929). \"Fishtail\\'s\" dad is killed when the rig is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice. When Henry is kidnapped Anderson tries to persuade \"Fishtail\" to sell his oil lease. It all ends well with oil being struck and \"Fishtail\" going to Military school.  It is okay for a rainy day.'\n",
      " b'Based on a true story, this television drama was filmed along Canada\\'s west coast, in winter. The cast and crew worked in icy waters and freezing rain. It was a miserable \"shoot\" but so was the horror of the real people involved. You will notice a very young and green Matt Leblanc in a roll years before \"Friends\". Robert Conrad was very strong and real...a true professional.  Richard Long'\n",
      " b\"Ok, I've seen plenty of movies dealing with witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird. This movie starts out as this cult of witches led by a really bad Orson Wells playing the staring role (couldn't they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a Satanist) he just did not belong in this movie at all. But anyhow, the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a miscarrage. The lady that had the miscarrage and her husband go off to a place called Lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there or she will die. The couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbors and friends. Then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disapears (that was creepy) as well as seeing the little boy belonging to Orson Wells at the playgroud that he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life. The lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself traped by it's inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about. This movie is ok, it's has it's moments of suspense but it really could have done much better than to have Orson in there.\"\n",
      " b\"BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap.  I've never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful. Like the movies I said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He is the worst out there.  The credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in. The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots. The editing is easily the worst. This movie made no sense and I unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I couldn't take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life.  DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP!\"\n",
      " b'Everyone likes a prison movie, and everyone likes a Gene Wilder-Richard Pryor comedy, so combine those two genres, and you\\'ve got a formidable piece of cinematic history. The two comedians play Skip Donahue and Harry Monroe, a pair of New Yorkers whose lives are going nowhere. After witnessing a very unpleasant scene in a bar, they decide to move out west. In Arizona, they get a job in a bank as dancing woodpeckers. Then, some thugs get hold of the costumes and rob the bank. The crime naturally gets pinned on Skip and Harry, who get put in jail. Adjusting to life behind bars isn\\'t all that easy for them, until Skip everyone discovers Skip\\'s rodeo talent.  Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor always made a great comedy team, and \"Stir Crazy\" is no exception. When I was in fifth grade and the teacher showed us \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\", she told everyone that Gene Wilder was a great actor in many movies. I said \"Stir Crazy\", and she asked \"Uh, did your parents let you see the whole thing?\" My parents did let me see the whole thing, although there are some scenes that make it R-rated. But it\\'s a really funny movie; you should see it.'\n",
      " b\"There's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just plain sucks. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. Essentially, what we have here is a feature length episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.\"\n",
      " b'Actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray Little Richard than Leon. He captures Little Richard to a most believable essence. The outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie. Although the movie is a little long, it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of Little Richard in mind. The ending should have taken a direction of moving Little Richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll as far as I am concerned regardless of what the other media says.'\n",
      " b\"This is a plot driven movie and extremely entertaining. Nothing startling or original within the plot, but crucially, it moves along at a great pace and therefore keeps your attention. I didn't really notice the acting which I guess is a good thing. John Mills was fine but did seem to take everything in his stride somewhat considering how his life was falling apart around him. He would be clumped on the head, stand up 20 seconds later, dust himself down and carry on as if nothing had happened. A minor quibble in a film with a strong story, authentic locations and a plot that continually keeps you guessing right up to its conclusion.\"\n",
      " b'Beautiful....that one word pretty much sums up this whole film. Everything from the cinematography, the directing, the acting.....brilliant. At any point of the film, you can pause it, and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or \"artsy fartsy\" as some people would say. I assure you, that after one viewing, \"Bobbycrush\" will be stuck in your head. I know this from first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film. Be thankful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) imagery.'\n",
      " b'The first of the two Snake Plissken movies (The second is \"Escape From L.A.\") this is an interesting, but strange view of the future in 1997, which is now, ironically, the past. Manhattan has become a massive prison filled with inmates but no guards and the prisoners run their own lives inside. This is completely unrealistic, but an interesting scenario. The president crashes his plane accidentally into the prison island and is held hostage by \"The Duke of New York\". Ex-fighter pilot Snake Plissken is sent in to retrieve the President and his important tape, which will be broadcast to Russia and China about politics, which he was carrying. Snake is led on a bizarre trip through Manhattan where he is attacked, battled by gladiators, and bombarded by bricks. The movie is fascinating but downright weird and is definitely a must-see for Sci-Fi fans.'\n",
      " b'I just didn\\'t get this movie...Was it a musical? no..but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it...  Was it a serious drama....no the acting was not good enough for that.  Is Whoopi Goldberg a quality serious Actor..Definently not.  I had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie. The message on apartheid and the \"tribute\" to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted. But as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse.  See for yourself, but in fairness I hated it'\n",
      " b'An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious \"Southern belle\" dub to show she\\'s from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. After barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who\\'s under the control of Jim Jones-type cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical mad guru-style things, like passing out LSD, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping Agren with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood. Every once in awhile a character will look to the right or left and see a gory scene lifted directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both of which were also directed by Lenzi). I\\'m pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST as well. Here we get the expected animal slaughter scenes (gutting a gator; natives eating live snakes), plus some additional nudity and a castration. Me Me Lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout playing a widow who is gang banged by three of her brother in laws on top of the ashes of her freshly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer briefly appears as a professor and isn\\'t given much to do.  So anyway, with MANGIATI VIVI! you pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles, so if you\\'re a sleaze hound, by all means watch it. Personally, I got bored with it about midway through and just wanted it to end. The original (heavily cut) U.S. release in 1985 was titled THE EMERALD JUNGLE in order to trick people into thinking they were actually renting John Boorman\\'s EMERALD FOREST. It was also called DOOMED TO DIE and EATEN ALIVE BY CANNIBALS!'\n",
      " b'**SPOILERS** Coming over to the Frame home in rural USA to be taken in as a member of the family young Emil Buckner, Skip Homeier, is anything but your typical American boy in fact he was brought up in Nazi Germany and brainwashed to grow up and become a future Aryan Superman in the Hitler Youth. That fact that Emil\\'s dad who was thrown into a Nazi concentration camp where he eventually died for speaking out against the Fuhrer, Adolph Hitler, made Emil look suspicious to his Nazi overseers who felt that he may well become like his dad, normal, when he grows up. The Nazis decided that he didn\\'t have what it takes to become a good and loyal member of the Nazi Party and sent packing to the US to stay with his old man\\'s brother-in-law Mike Frame, Fredic March, and his future wife Leona Richards, Betty Fields.  Not getting the hint that he was a total wash out, in him not having what it takes to be a good Nazi, from his beloved Nazi Germany Emil ,because of him being brainwashed since he could barley walk, still thinks that he\\'s a full fledged Nazi Superman and goes so far as to parade around the house, this in 1944 when the US was at war with Nazi Germany, with his Nazi or Hitler Youth uniform. Emil makes a complete jerk of himself in him trying to be a spy for the Fatherland and at the same time blowing his cover, by bragging about it, and not realizing that the Fatherland, wanting nothing at all to do with this nut, had him unceremoniously kicked out!  Acting like a Nazified version of \"Dennis the Menace\" Emil is all over the house and even at school trying to prove to everyone, including himself, what a great Nazi Superman he really is. For a while Emil does get his classmates to go along with his crazy antics that he picked up back in Germany while in the Hitler Youth. Emil has his classmates take night marches into enemy territory and staging roadside ambushes, all in fun of course, while being disguised in camouflage so that the enemy, whoever he is, can\\'t see them as well as familiarizing themselves with all kinds of arms and ammunitions, German of course.  Emil goes a bit too far when he first comes to deal with Leona, his Uncle Mike\\'s fianc\\xc3\\xa9e, being Jewish as well as his determination to steal Mike\\'s mail that he gets from the War Department. Mike is one of the country\\'s top chemist and is working on a top secret project for the US military, the Atomic Bomb?, and Emil wants to get his hands on what he\\'s doing by stealing his private notes and mail and send it back to the Fatherland. In the case of his future aunt Leona the fact that she\\'s Jewish is enough to drive Emil batty in thinking that he\\'ll be forced to live under the same roof as she is when she marries his Uncle Mike: a fate worse then death itself for the cute but somewhat not all there in the head little Nazi.   Two things happen that turn Emil around in his mission, or what he thinks it is, in serving his Fatherland. Confronting Leona about her being Jewish, in the most vulgar of ways, she slaps Emil across the face that shocks the very self-assured and arrogant young man in him, ,an Aryan Superman, not only being whacked by a lowly woman but a Jewish one at that! The second incident that brings Emil back to reality has to do with his getting into a fight with fellow student Stanley Dumbowski, Rudy Wissle. Stanley being a Polish/American whom Emil felt to be inferior to him was able to take him on and give him a bloody nose and even later force Emil, with their teacher Miss. Richards looking on, to apologies to him in front of all his classmates; What An Insult!  With all his arrogance about being a good Nazi now in question the only thing that can bring back Emil to his fantasy world of serving Fuhrer and Fatherland is to get his hands on Uncle Mike\\'s secret papers and send them back to Germany, by US airmail?, to show everyone back home what a good German, or Aryan, he really is. Emil is stymied in his plan to serve the Fatherland when he\\'s caught red-handed, with his hands in Uncle Mike\\'s drawer, by his young cousin Pattie, Joan Carroll, who just bought him a birthday present, a illuminated watch which he always wanted for his crazy nighttime war maneuvers. All at once Emil graduated from just being just a pesky and uncontrollable but somewhat harmless young boy to a possibly up and coming psycho killer the very type of person that would make those back in the Fatherland, the Nazis, very proud of him.  Intriguing movie about how a young man can be so seriously brainwashed that he goes against his best interests to serve a country and ideology, Nazi Germany, that did nothing but harm him and his family. Where at the same time having him try to destroy, in his own childless way, the country and its people that did nothing but help him in every way it and they could despite his dislike of both of them.  Emil does see the light at the end the movie, or tunnel, in how he was treated by his Uncle Mike and especially Leona, a Jew who in his mind is the eternal enemy of his beloved Third Reich, as well as his victim of violence Pattie in the kindness and understanding as well as love that they all showed to him.This kindness and understanding is something that he never would have gotten, if he did what he did here back there, in Nazi Germany.'\n",
      " b\"Joan Crawford is in her element here! As a deceitful, manipulative woman with the Medusa touch she's in her glory. You get the feeling she's enjoying herself immensely. Hell, you even get the feeling she's enjoying the costumes! She tears into the part of Eva Phillips as if it were her last meal, and takes the rest of the cast along for the ride. They don't make movies like this anymore and it's a shame. It's good, clean, sinister fun with Joan in control every step of the way.\"\n",
      " b'No one goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same is true for the majority of low-rent horror flicks, especially those Roger Ebert has dubbed \"Dead Teenager Movies.\" The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a Dead Teenager Movie, only here, the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military trainees.  Some will argue the line \"it\\'s only a movie\" when questionable facts are raised in a movie review, but I\\'ve always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be rooted in reality in order to be effective. In the Hills Have Eyes 2, we\\'re to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise, but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert. The dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess. Though the films aren\\'t nearly comparable, I kept imagining these \"soldiers\" being in Platoon, and shuddering with dread.  Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues: radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations; a Colonel is addresses as \"hey, asshole\" by a Private. And nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do, or any sense of command structure, when things begin to go wrong. I think of the soldiers in James Cameron\\'s Aliens, a film of pure fantasy, and how even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy rooted in reality.  I try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10, and judge it\\'s strengths and weaknesses from there. You have to allow concessions for the material; there\\'s no way Star Wars is as good of a movie as The Godfather, on equal terms. But both are excellent examples of their type.  In that respect, while the Hills Have Eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing, it\\'s only modestly worse in that regard than the typical Dead Teenager Movie. On a technical side, the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective. Scenes that are intended to shock, or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work. So, while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death, there are certainly far worse horror flicks in circulation.  It\\'s worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage, or those who don\\'t tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the Best Ever or the Worst Ever of all time. If you don\\'t \"get\" horror, especially the Dead Teenager variety, you\\'re not likely to have a good time with this one.  4/10'\n",
      " b'This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ. I know the house that it is based on as well as the person. As you see at the end of themovie, she was killed in the world trade center incident. I know that, because I was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains. (She was the only one in our area lost). The nudity in the movie went a bit far. I am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing. This movie is in poor taste and I cannot see how her family would give there blessing to it. This is an insult to the person whom it is based on.'\n",
      " b\"I saw this series when it first premiered in 2003, and I really liked it! It had characters like Des Kaye and Ray McCooney, who were actually quite funny. I liked the show a lot, and couldn't wait for it to return.  Then series 2 arrived. I was shocked by the drop in quality. No more clever, versatile characters like Ray McCooney. Repetitive, disgusting (and not in a funny way) characters like Bubbles De Vere and that puking woman (can't remember her name!) were the focus now. Even classic characters like Lou and Andy had become shadows of themselves.  I saw series 3, in hopes it would improve, but to my dismay it got even worse! I left the series with a bitter taste in my mouth, and went off to re-watch a true classic (Brass Eye).  I saw the rating of 8.0, and was amazed at how high it was. One great series, followed by two god-awful ones, does not deserve something higher than a 4.  My advice, buy series 1 if you're curious. Save your money on the rest (including Little Britain USA).  Rating 4/10\"\n",
      " b\"This movie from what I remember was such a great movie! I watched it on television when I was 11, and couldn't remember the title of it. If I remember correctly, I do believe that it was a Christmas television movie special. One of my friends at work and I were discussing it several years back, but neither one of us could remember the title. But we did remember almost the entire movie. No one else at work remembered ever seeing it! Thank goodness someone at a TV movie website answered my post! Now I have the fun job of locating a copy of it! It's amazing what you can remember as a child, but this movie definitely remains vividly playing in my head... even after 28 years. And I do believe I only watched it once. Maybe it was because I am the oldest sister in my family, or maybe because I babysat and worked in day care centers, that it stuck with me that long. Regardless of the real reason, it has remained one of the movies that I have been really wanting to watch lately!!! If anyone knows where to watch it online, or has a copy, please let me know. I would so love to see it again!!!! Thanks so much! Seriously, I tried to post this and it says my comment isn't long enough. So, apparently I have to type more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billingsley who starred in A Christmas Story? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea on where to find this I would greatly appreciate it.\"\n",
      " b\"Well, at least this one has closed captions AND DVD captions...if anyone cares! So, the deaf and hard of hearing can also enjoy watching films that are awful piles of dreck! It's interesting that two films in the IMDb Bottom 100 have similar titles. There is SNOWBOARD ACADEMY and SURF SCHOOL--which would apparently indicate that some sort of trend might be occurring. Perhaps there will be a ROLLER BLADE UNIVERSITY or the like coming out in the next few years!   When the film begins, it's obvious that writer Joel Silverman had watched a lot of formulaic teen films from the last 25 years. All the characters seem like caricatures. There is the female Japanese exchange student who doesn't speak English (a knockoff of the female French exchange student from BETTER OFF DEAD), the hyper-religious mom and her hyper-square virgin son (straight from CARRIE--but without the insane magic powers), the obligatory black teen (from practically ALL teen movies--and why do they always come in ones?!), the punk rock-ish boy with weird hair (again, from most teen films), the Goth girl who is so obviously 'hot' underneath all that black makeup (but, of course, no one recognizes this) and gear and the very nice AND hot leading man (can't the leading guy NOT be hot for once?!). It's all about as believable as the Tooth Fairy and betrays hack writing.  Taylor Negron and Diane Delano play an older couple who are rather repulsive. It's not just that they behave like horny dogs in heat but they are just gross people. Not a particularly pleasant couple and not what any sane person would consider 'comic relief'! There is a chimp on hand as well. Whenever the ape appears, references to bestiality seem to follow. Nice touch, huh?! The appearance of Harland William did not bode well. While he can be funny when he just talks off the cuff on TV, in films he has a very strong propensity to appear in ANYTHING...as long as it's bad. When ROCKETMAN is one of the best movie of his career, you know you're in trouble! The females in the movie, with the exception of the Goth girl, are there for pretty much one thing...sex. They are horny bimbos who have no depth whatsoever or personalities and they are nothing but walking pairs of breasts--which you see quite often. I doubt if N.O.W. would approve.  The film is about a group of losers (listed above) who go to Costa Rica a week ahead of their fellow senior class members so they can ski the K-2...no, wait, that's also BETTER OFF DEAD (and about 4523 other teen films). No, they want to learn to surf and out-surf the stuck-up jerks who are graduating with them in only a few weeks. Wow,...now that's an important and worthwhile goal!   Overall, there is really nothing to recommend this film. It's unfunny, crude, horribly written and appallingly unlikable. Remarks about body crabs and crotch itching, images of Williams sitting on the toilet taking a dump and, once again, the bestiality references make this one abominably offensive and stupid film. I could only imagine it being of interest to people who are either actively psychotic or under the influence of very, very strong intoxicants. A loser of a film that I couldn't have hated any more. Repellent garbage...at best.  Currently, this film is ranked #50 on the IMDb Bottom 100 of the worst films ever made. I think this is way too generous and might just give the impression that this film is better than it actually is!\"\n",
      " b'Warning, Spoilers! ...but it was somewhat entertaining if only for the cheesiness factor. The story is one of the most predictable I\\'ve seen in a long time and the swordfights (if you can call them that) are beyond laughable, but nevertheless, both me and my SO spent an otherwise bored saturday night watching this made-for-tv drivel. People have compared this movie to the excellent \"The Princess Bride\" but as a slightly jaded and cynical viewer, I\\'d have to argue that \"The Princess Bride\" is a lot more enjoyable in every single aspect (swordfights - I weep when I even compare the two, dialogue, plot, characters, and just overall silliness) when compared to this movie. This movie is simply not as clever as \"The Princess Bride\" nor does it aspire to be, which works in some ways for its own made-for-tv charm.   It\\'s not horrendous by any means, but unless you\\'re bored silly, I wouldn\\'t rush out to see it either. My SO and I did get quite a few chuckles at several points in the movie, including the part where Froderick jumped in front of the Prince and saved his life (of course, the Sheriff happened to have only one arrow) and of course, the priceless \"You got egg in your beard\" line by Robin. Sure they had to use almost every medieval cliche in the book (including the worst kiss I\\'ve ever seen), but at least I didn\\'t pay to watch it. The cast was overall mediocre and the plot would amuse those under 12 or anyone who is gullible enough to believe two guys can escape unnoticed in the night and find a canoe and THEN go across the English Channel without oars. Overall 4/10'\n",
      " b'I think that the movie was absolutely excellent! I think that it is even more than what I expected it to be, because it goes deeper than the first one. I appreciate a lot about the script the fact that it follows life\\'s \"precedure\", so to speak: bad luck brings not one, but many misfortunes. I also think that it shows very well how it is extremely hard to maintain oneself on top once one gets there. The action sequences are meticulously combined with the dramatic and romantic moments, which maintain a certain rush of adrenaline. I definitely loved how the football matches were shot and the effects and the music was more than perfect! Sure there are some little exaggerations(some of the goal, some of the football stunts), but the shivers that one gets when seeing Raul, Beckam, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Zidane and other football stars giving their best on the pitch is worth every second of it. My recommendation is to watch it...and to feel it! Because football comes from the heart!'\n",
      " b'Before any Westerner visits India for the first time, I strongly recommend them to view Outsourced prior to their arrival. The \"bread and butter\" of the movie is that there is so much one can learn by analyzing some of the customs and trends of Indian culture.   Outsourced is a very light-spirited venture about the life of an American sales manager who is prompted to make a business trip to India in order to train his replacements. All the characters are likable and the key situations that occur seem realistic. (Of course the majority of the cast is obviously Indian so it would make sense.) It was interesting to see the main character go through the transition from adjusting to vegetarianism, learning compassion through generosity, consciously eating with the right hand and other habits.  Being a good hearted film, the only thing outsourced lacks is some prolonged suspense. There is nothing too dramatic about the changes the main character had to go through other than his initial embrace to Indian life, a mild issue with an extra-marital affair, and the brief moment where he had to tell his trainees that they\\'ve been laid off. Everything seemed just a little too easy though I am aware it is in the culture of the supporting cast to positively adjust to change.  As said before, I would recommend this movie to any American or Western traveller to forewarn them of the culture shock that he/she would face. I\\'ve actually enjoyed this movie to my surprise.'\n",
      " b'This show is literally depressing to watch. I\\'ve seen two or three episodes now, and wish I hadn\\'t. After they were over, I was disgusted.  Essentially this is just a TV show where a camera crew follow around the \"Playboy Bunnies\" in the Playboy Mansion.  If you don\\'t know what Playboy is, who Hugh Hefner is, what Playboy Bunnies are, or anything about porn, chances are you will have no interest in this whatsoever. I know all of the above and it still made me feel sick.  Obviously a certain portion of this is scripted for dramatic effect and viewer appeal but, I think, probably very little. These bleach-blonde bimbos are incredibly stupid, selfish and appalling. Yeah, they\\'re hot. But when they open their mouths, you feel like vomiting.  It\\'s kind of sad to see Heff (at age 79) courting these girls. The Head Bunny, a.k.a. \"Heff\\'s Girlfriend,\" is probably no older than 30. All the girls kiss him and he fondles them... twenty years ago Heff was a god. Now, he looks like one of those disgusting old pervs in shopping centers who stare at young girls all day. He\\'s the type of guy you want to call the cops on. And he\\'s loose in his own mansion surrounded by dozens of beautiful women.  Likewise, they are taking advantage of him - they know he\\'ll die soon and they\\'re really milking his old-age for all its worth. They get free rooms as well as free food and the best thing of all: they get paid for being sexy and rich! The richer and more beautiful they are, the more they get paid. The more they show, the more they get paid. Apparently, all they have going for them is their looks - they are dumber than I don\\'t know what.  They are so stupid some of the episodes are painful to watch. They made me feel sick in my stomach - the Bunnies are gorgeous? Sure. But good god, they\\'re ridiculously dense.  In my opinion, the only \"plus\" about this show is that we get a rare glimpse inside the Playboy Mansion... but ol\\' Heff will be dead in a few years, and supposedly according to his own wishes the mansion will soon thereafter become open to the public. Now THAT will be fun.'\n",
      " b'I remember all the hype around this movie when Aaliyah was killed. Being a fan of Ms. Rice\\'s novels, my first thought was \"how can they do Queen Of The Damned without doing Vampire Lestat first?\"  Having finally seen the movie, now I can see how they did it. If you have read these books, imagine taking out the gory parts from Vampire Lestat, cramming Marcus and Marius into one character, and removing everything to do with Lestat\\'s beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the Theatre Of The Vampires, and also Louis, Claudia, and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes cramming in Queen Of The Damned.  What we loose is a very important piece of Lestat\\'s character. His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle, and all the other vampires.  Also important to the story is that we loose the \"Story Of The Twins\", which is the Genesis of Ms. Rice\\'s vampires. And while I am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient Egypt.  Even worse, we have this love interest thrown in between Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story. For those that do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics). But in Yoni, it is about gay male relationships, told by a female. While I am sure many men object to the \"gayness\" of the characters, in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way. For instead of Lestat persueing killers, he goes after young female groupies.  And the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast. At the beginning Lestat emerges from a century long sleep, then later on asks Marius how he made it through the 1950\\'s in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he slept through that period. Makes you wonder how Lestat knows about 50\\'s fashion and music, since he slept through the same time period himself. And nothing is ever even mentioned about Louis, Claudia, or Gabrielle. I think that is a huge shame. Is like seeing \"Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs\".  Overall, the movie I thought was really bad. About the only good thing about it was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all of the really in-depth parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like Enkil after he was sucked dry.  If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original Interview With A Vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows. Let this one Rest In Piece, with a stake through the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck, and a vial of Holy Water in the mouth.  In ending, remember that before Aaliyah was killed, this was intended to go straight to video, no theatrical release was planned. It is obvious now why this was. It is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where she really might have shined.  I rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10.'\n",
      " b'I was at this site some weeks ago and either missed this page for RH or it is new. I am delighted to have found so much info. both on the cast and the story line. RH was being aired on Soapnet (89) on cable, and then out of the blue they redid the schedule which was to exclude that great show. It now airs one day (sun.) from 6;30am to 7;00 it comes to 1 hr. of watching. I have read so much lately all over the net, wherever soaps are discussed, as to how much shows like this are missed. AW was pulled completely. I think that the nostalgia for saner time in our history is a big part of why this show is now getting so much attention. It would be great if it were put out on DVD and that way the really avid viewer can just purchase it. Well that was my thought and thanks for letting me express it. imm'\n",

Barbara Steele, is her usual beautiful/creepy self. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. The whole movie is dripping with atmosphere, and there is a good deal of tension throughout. The camera angles are good and the acting, for the most part, isn\\'t bad. This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have the DVD uncut version, which is far superior to the edited TV version. Grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, settle back and enjoy.

      " b\"This film shows John Carpenter's film direction at it's best. Carpenter wrote this script after his house was robbed, and it shows. This dark view of a future world was meant to show where things were heading at the time with the crime rate rising as we were heading into the 1980's. Carpenter as always wrote a solid script, this time with help from his old film school buddy Nick Castle, who also was the original horror icon Michael Myers in John Carpenter's Halloween.  This film stars a great all-star John Carpenter cast of Kurt Russell, Donald Pleasence, Lee Van Cleef, Harry Dean Stanton, Charles Cyphers and Carpenter's Ex-Wife Adrienne Barbeau.  Great plot with great character makes this one of John Carpenter's best films, it is a shame they had to cut out the start of the movie when it was put in theaters in 1981, where Snake Plissken and his partner do the robbery and later, Snake's partner gets killed, and Snake gets caught by the United States Police Force.  Also a great score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth, this film is not to be missed by any fan of John Carpenter, sci-fi, horror or film in general.\"\n",
      " b'In the opening sequences of the film, we see three Hollywood big-shots; one, an actress, the other a director, and the third, a writer. All three very successful at what they do. The trio are in different ways connected to Johnathan Shields, who at the present time is trying to get the three to be a part of his comeback. The three are in no way anxious to work with him once again. Johnathan, a big time Hollywood producer, ran his career into the ground by pushing away people, who in the end could of prolonged his at one time successful profession. The three go on to tell their own intriguing stories how they met Shields, explaining how they grew to resent him.  Georgia, (played wonderfully by Lana Turner) now a popular actress began as a bit player in one of Shields films. Shield\\'s in time, casts her as a lead in one of his pictures. Her anxiety\\'s of ruining her big break almost lead her to miss her fortunate opportunity. The film becomes a success, solidifying Georgia as a respected actress. She soon discovers Johnathan romancing another woman, leading her to walk away from her contract with Shields, finding success elsewhere with another studio.  Jim, a writer, has his novel purchased by Shields to be turned into a motion picture. At Shields request, he approaches Jim to write the screenplay to the film. Jim dislikes Johnathan at first, in time, seeing him as something better. The two travel to the countryside to finish the screenplay. Before-hand, Johnathan asks an actor to keep Jim\\'s clingy wife away for a while. His wife Rosemary, and the actor have a misfortunate accident and are killed in plane crash. Unknowingly, Johnathan reveals to Jim, that he had a hand in his wife\\'s accidental death, marking the end of their friendship.  Then there\\'s Fred, the hopeful and aspiring director, who of all places meets Shields at the man\\'s fathers funeral. In time, the two become partners and make a few films together, mostly mediocre pictures. Fred recommends to Johnathan, that the two do a picture that is at first deemed impossible. After it gets the green-light, out of nowhere, Johnathan doesn\\'t name Fred the picture\\'s director, ironically, saying he wasn\\'t experienced enough. Obviously feeling betrayed Fred walks away like Georgia did and acquires prosperity as a director, on his own.  The reasons for all of Johnathan\\'s bizarre doings, is for the most part, because of his own need to live up to his father\\'s name, who founded \\'Shields Productions\\', and became a big player in the industry. In the process he estranges himself from everyone who means something to him. The phrase, \"what goes around, comes around\" really comes into play, in the films climax. One of definite greats of the 1950\\'s. Easily one of my Top 20 of all time.'\n",
      " b'This got to be on of the worst movies ever. The plot was terrible, the action scenes boring and the whole thing totally crap. Good action films makes you forget that some things are unrealistic, like having 100 bullets in a gun. This movie is not like that at all. Here it just seems silly. And the ending is crap as well.   The only good thing is Lance Hendriksen who can actually act, otherwise do not waste your time on this movie.'\n",
      " b'I really hate most end of the world movies. They show what jaded Hollywood people think of the rest of the world, and they clearly think we\\'re a bunch of sadistic idiots (or at least that watching sadistic idiots react to things is somehow entertaining). I\\'ve been to L.A. many times, I have family that works in show business, and I just want to say that these are the *last* people we should be looking to for a reality check. Some disaster movies at least paint a clever picture: Children of Men, 12 Monkeys, but usually the message is just \"people will do anything to survive, all is dark and sad and purposeless, we should all be ashamed of ourselves\".  Don\\'t get me wrong, I like the idea of a story that explores throwing off the system of social order and testing people\\'s mettle in the face of horror, and I do believe some people would act like this film portrayed, but sadistic idiots aside, I seriously doubt society would just dissolve into every man for himself, that\\'s just insulting.'\n",
      " b\"A hit at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, first time director Patricia Riggen's Under The Same Moon or La Misma Luna (in Spanish) is that rare film that's about real people dealing with life's issues that resonate in today's hectic and cruel world. The drama centers on a little Mexican boy, Carlitos (Adrian Alonso), who lives with his ailing guelita (grandmother) in Mexico; when she suddenly dies in her sleep, he sets off to Los Angeles to be reunited with his mother, who's been working as a maid for rich folks. His plan to make the journey across the US/Mexico border doesn't pan out as easily as he had planned, running into stumbling blocks that involve street thugs, migrant workers, a heroin addict, near kidnapping and the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service).   Under The Same moon is a fantastic little Mexican-American film that subtlety transcends the hot topic of illegal immigration. But it's the story of Carlitos and his mother Rosario (Kate del Castillo) that makes this film a definite must see. Child actor Adrian Alonso stands out and basically carries the film, as he gives such a compelling and truthful performance; it's one of those young performances of recent years that will be remembered. Kate del Castillo, as well, exudes that motherly instinct in her tired, stressed-out expressions with such sadness, one can only feel for her. Eugenio Derbez adds some comic flair as the stranger that ends up helping Carlitos to find his mother. At first, he wants nothing to do with him as he, too, is in the states illegally, but then becomes a father figure, realizing the chiquito needs all the help he can get. Ugly Betty's America Ferrera, in a brief role, is good as one who smuggles Mexicans into the U.S. in order to pay for her college tuition. No matter what you think about illegal immigration, Under The Same Moon is a terrific movie about hope, love, survival and the yearning for family, no matter what the consequences. It also pulls at your heartstrings. It's a powerful little film that will move you and perhaps, bring you to tears.   Note: Under The Same Moon will most likely be playing in major Metropolitan cities, so if you can find it, I highly recommend this movie.\"\n",
      " b'*A few spoilers, perhaps.* The first two stories were all right. Especially, for being stories within stories (Lovecraft\\'s trademark). Richard Lynch was brilliant, as the sea captain who goes temporarily insane with grief. And, David Warner was absolutely convincing as the true-love-starved immortal, ultimately betrayed by his over-possessive housekeeper. The third one, though? YECHH! The only thing truly Lovecraftian about it was the small touch of Negrophobia in it. *Sad but true; HPL was a closet racist. Just read \"Call of Cthulu!\"* I guess the nicest touch was the subtle homage to a similar anthology: the British b/w classic \"Dead of Night.\" The wrap-around segment, and its conclusion, strongly reminded me of the former! I guess, in all fairness, that my final score for this movie boils down to: 2.7 stars.'\n",
      " b\"This is simply one of the best movies ever made because it's so funny and the creators didn't intend for it to be. It is an instant cult classic along with the Turkish Star Wars and Turkish Star Trek.  I remember the first time I saw this movie the year was 1996 and I just couldn't stop laughing at the fake ninja tree fight scene. The next time it aired on TV I had the VCR at the ready. I must have watched it a good 10 times and showed it to all my friends and they pretty much had the same reaction as me. I literally freaked out when my dad taped a football game over it.  I needed to find this movie again!! After 10 years of searching I finally found it through the magic of the interweb.  I was expecting it to loose some of its luster over the years and all the hype my friends put it through back in the day but it didn't. It still made me laugh just as hard as when I first watched it.\"\n",

      " b\"Joan Collins stars in this hilarious giant bug epic. Producer-director Bert I. Gordon, the genius behind such stuff-grows-really-big films as The Amazing Colossal Man and Village of the Giants, brings us a cautionary tale of what can happen when pollution, real-estate scams, and social insects mix. Collins, an absolute portrait of the valiant trouper who keeps plugging away no matter how bad the script gets, stars as shady land developer Marilyn Fryer. Marilyn is by only a small margin the sleaziest of a band of characters so repellent it's hard not to root for the ants (who, by the way, grow really big). A ludicrous plot and jaw-droopingly bad dialog make Empire of the Ants ideal for late-night viewing. Watch it with your most vicious circle of friends. DVD version includes the original trailer and French and Spanish subtitles.\"\n",
      " b\"Yet another example of the complete waste of UK Lottery money. Just how commercial did this film prove. The Film Council ,who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded, on one of the London Undergrounds disused stations, for allowing this clich\\xc3\\xa9d, dismal specimen to be committed to film, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, most notably Deathline. Amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute. It's a little bit too late then! Surely all those development executives, at the UK Film Council, could have noticed this at the script stage. Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare.\"\n",
      " b\"After years of hearing from film magazines about how wonderful Blue Sunshine was, I decided to give it a shot when it appeared on TV one night. All I have to say is wow. That was possibly one of the most painfully dull experiences I've ever had. The writing is shoddy, the actors all appear as if they came to this film from the porn business and the film meanders along at a pace that would put a slug to shame. The only saving grace that I found in this film was a snazzy little score that unfortunately also seemed somewhat out of place. And praise be that Zalman King has left the acting business for directing because I would rather watch his erotic flicks than sit through another painful Jerry performance.\"\n",
      " b\"Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond. Once on the trail they come upon Joanne Dru, who maybe John Ford saw in Red River, and offered her a much better part in this film. In the Morman train are a number of notable characters. The Mormans are a peaceable group who are challenged along the way by a truly lowlife group of outlaws. In their case (the outlaws), in the case of the people on the train, and later a band of Navajos whom they encounter, and in the well written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the film completely evades stereotypes, while the camera seems to spend as much time giving the viewer the big picture of Monument Valley framing the train as it moves along with a few water crossings along the way, in stunning black and white and then coming back to what's happening in this rolling community, all to the accompaniment of the beautiful vocalizations of the Sons of the Pioneers.\"\n",
      " b'Indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the bad guys. The honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end.  This movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives. The direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who. The music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as Indian cinema goes.  The movie is slow at times and the dilemma which Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is overplayed at times. But I would still give this one 9/10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit.'\n",

Like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks, next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider, next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work.  I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think that if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie. If, however, you find his work/not funny then I would recommend staying away from this one.'\n",
      " b'\"Tears of the Black Tiger\" is apparently a post-modern homage / parody to 1960s Thai westerns. I generally hate this kind of ironic parody film making, but I definitely enjoyed this film. It may be because I had no idea that Thailand made western films in the 1960s, let alone seen any of them, that this film proved rather effective. It isn\\'t perfect, but its such a colorful, entertaining, and above all unique and strange film that its difficult to dislike.  Part of the reason why it works so well is that the storyline and characters are reasonably involving. Its not extremely well developed, but has a sense of romanticism which, like Douglas Sirk at his best, is involving despite being campy. The film is pure style over substance, but the style is so engaging I really didn\\'t mind too much. The acting is pretty good as well, despite the fact that the characters don\\'t carry a whole lot of weight.  This brings me to the one thing that prevented me from loving the film. Mentioned earlier, this is a post-modern parody. The set designs were so colorful and dreamlike, plus the story was actually involving, the constant bits of ironic humor really got on my nerves. I really wish the filmmakers had been more sincere with the material, because the winking at the camera prevents one from being truly lost in the dreamlike style. I may be missing the point completely here (again, I am not familiar at all with the movies this pays tribute to, so I\\'m not sure if the originals were the same way). However, the movie is very enjoyable and certainly different that I found it worthwhile, despite not being as great as it could\\'ve been. (7/10)'\n",
      " b\"There is not one thing about this movie that is good.  The first half of the movie focuses on this guy shooting up, and hanging out with half-naked men. The guy's friend overdoses and dies, causing him to continue his downward spiral into street drugs which completely turns him into a junkie.  Suddenly, the junkie starts to hallucinate, and see his dead friend (who is still half-naked, even as a mirage) who tells him to kill people. The junkie obliges, and starts to murder random people who come into the business (that looks more like an abandoned warehouse) where he is working, since everybody in town somehow has a key to the front door.  Despite the jackhammer being attached to an extension cord, the junkie is still able to chase people and kill them, easily. And, for some reason, when he is injected with what looks like radioactive waste, it actually gives him superpowers, and he regains all his stamina and is able to jump onto rooftops from the ground (after falling off of them).  The acting is atrocious, the story is incredibly boring, the make-up was crappy, the dialogue was terrible, etc. basically, just everything about this movie was complete garbage.  And, seriously, what was up with all of the half-naked men? I think every male character stripped for absolutely no reason at all. I'm glad they all got killed by a super-powered, jackhammer-wielding drug addict.\"\n",

Some fifth columnists meet and mysteriously start dying off with a Japanese dagger in their hands after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) shows up.  Soon the Lone Ranger arrives in the person of FBI Agent Richard 'Dick' Martin (Clayton Moore). Martin is ineffective in finding the killer as he is more interested in the niece (Joan Barclay) of a missing doctor, who is part of the gang.  After the last man dies, and the doctor is horribly disfigured by some strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and that is where it gets interesting and weird. I won't spill it.  Lugosi was marvelous as the skulking killer.\"\n",

There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice.  I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government. It\\'s interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero.  Not a great flick, it\\'s really typically a \"B\" action flick. Michael York lends some class to this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is kind of \"blah\" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he\\'d have chemistry with anyone he\\'s doing a scene with. Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer, it would\\'ve been an above average \"B\" action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy. He\\'s very blonde and very villainous in this movie.  Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It\\'s okay. It doesn\\'t suck too bad. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could\\'ve moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what Russia looks like today!'\n",
      " b'Fracture is a solid but flawed courtroom drama/thriller that offers terrific acting and a compelling story, but it also suffers from typical \"Hollywood-izing\" that undermines the ending to the point of complete incredulity.  *spoilers* The filmmakers, who up until the last act have fashioned a terrific cat-and-mouse game between Hopkins and Gosling, took the easy way out and turned Hopkins from a clever genius into a bumbling fool. When Gosling\\'s boss (aka his conscience) tells him, \"If it makes you feel any better you let a man get away with ATTEMPTED murder,\" I (along with many others I am sure) knew how the movie would end. But it was not true to Hopkins\\' brilliant character that he too would have thought of this major loophole. A man who ingeniously constructs such an intricately plotted way to get away with the crime doesn\\'t think about the fact that he can be tried again? Not buying it.  I spent a lot of time criticizing this one fatal flaw, but overall I am still giving the movie a 7, because the rest of it (with the exception of the tepid romantic subplot) was so good and so effective. I just wish the filmmakers would have delivered an edgier ending and not stuck with the Hollywood conventional wrap-up.'\n",
      " b'While the gameplay of Jedi Knight II is far superior to Jedi Knight, I think the game is a bit of a dissapointment in other areas. For one thing, I much prefer the live action cutscenes in JK1 to the ones rendered with the game engine in JK2. The live action cutscenes really brought the story to life in JK1. Since the acting in JK2 is done by Quake 3 models, the cutscenes lack any sign of life. They look especially lifeless and flat where there are supposed to be emotional scenes, such as Jan and Kyle kissing.  I have played JK1 many times and I always watch the cutscenes fully. I even go back sometimes just to watch the cutscenes because they are done so well. When I play JK2 again, I\\'ll probably just skip the cutscenes because I think they look very amateurish. It\\'s almost as if the cutscenes are an afterthought to join the levels together, not as a part of the overall story as in Jedi Knight.  *Spoilers below*  Now we come to the story. While JK2\\'s story is ok, it is no where near as good as JK1. In the beginning of the game we find out that Kyle has given up his force abilities. He and Jan now operate as mercenaries for the New Republic. After several levels fighting imperials, it appears as if Jan is killed by a Dark Jedi called Desann. Kyle then goes to Luke Skywalker to get his lightsaber and force abilities back so he can avenge Jan\\'s death.  Now here is the really odd part about this story. It doesn\\'t seem to bother Luke that Kyle wants to regain his force powers so he can get revenge. If I understand Star Wars correctly, revenge along with fear, hate, agression, etc... will lead to the Dark side! Don\\'t you think Luke would try to object to this a bit more? The rest of it is pretty average \"kill the bad guy and get the girl\" type stuff.  *Spoilers end*  Overall, Raven have done an excellent job with the gameplay and level design, but the story is pretty average and I REALLY WANT PROPER CUTSCENES!!!  I gave it 8/10 though because the game is a lot of fun to play and the multiplayer is excellent. If it wasn\\'t for the excellent gameplay, I would have only given it 5/10.'\n",

If, by any chance, you're not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the finale. Of course, you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think THE CAT'S PAW is not available on video/DVD yet. Watch your PBS listings!\"\n",
      " b\"I am ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most redeeming factor to owning the DVD is the short film in the bonus features. My vote for this movie is a big fat ZERO. Don't misunderstand, I'm a horror girl. but i want some meat behind the story, not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans, not to be tricked in to watching, what seemed like forever, clips of animal snuff. Acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting. If i was forced to make a comparison to another film, the only one that comes to mind is Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch.\"\n",
      " b'I have watched all 21 Bond movies made so far. Casino Royale is not the worst-made of the series, just the most offensive one. The only other time the Bond franchise attempted a complete departure from the established Bond formula the result was the complete flop of License To Kill, which led to a change of direction and the fantastic Goldeneye. But unfortunately this time the experiment was a success, so I\\'m afraid of what will follow. Both License To Kill and Casino Royale have been praised as \"a return to the Fleming spirit\", when in truth they are nothing more than shameless attempts to cash in on popular fads of their time: the Bronson / Arnold / Stallone action films of the 80s in the case of License, the Bourne / Transporter films in the case of Casino. Daniel Craig is not a bad actor, but he is no doubt the worst Bond impersonator so far, his lack of class and charisma is almost astonishing. Of course his \"do I look like a give a damn\" line and his fighting prowess will wow 15-year-olds, but those who remember Connery, Moore, Dalton (in The Living Daylights), Brosnan, even that weirdo Lazenby, may feel like crying at what has become of their beloved icon. Of course you could ask the producers why this supposedly first mission of 007 is set in 2006 and if that means they have dared to completely write off 44 years and 20 films that allowed them to make this one, but their response will probably be \"Do we look like we give a damn?\".  If Casino Royale didn\\'t pretend to be a part of the Bond series, I would give it 6 out of 10, but it does, so it\\'s a 2.'\n",
      " b'SEX MONSTER (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not a porno... except for some four letters words and some swimming pool nudity this is as benign as a typical TV sitcom. Actually, the movie is basically an episode of Bewitched... except instead of the husband being upset about his wife\\'s use of witchcraft he becomes upset at the emergence of her latent lesbianism. Mariel Hemingway actually gives a very good, amusing performance as the prim and proper wife who turns into the insatiable \"sex monster\" after she gives in to her husband\\'s suggestion of a menage a trois. Unfortunately, writer/director/star Mike Binder\\'s character is a poor cross between Woody Allen and Paul Reiser and doesn\\'t do much to help this film rise about it\\'s poor script. Actually it\\'s not too much of a stretch to imagine Reiser and Helen Hunt playing these roles... it would have made an eye-popping \"Mad About You\" series finale! Events are about as predictable as you can imagine... husband talks wife into a threesome... wife winds up enjoying it more than the guy... guy starts to feel jealous and inadequate. Hemingway\\'s performance is the only thing that keeps the movie from being a completely tiresome bore... not that I am recommending it... it\\'s just to bad that her still-prodigious screen talent isn\\'t being utilized more.'\n",

      " b'Well, I generally like Iranian movies, and after having seen \"10\" by Kiarostami the night before, I was expecting a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is by far, the worst Iranian film, and one of the most boring Asian movies I have ever seen. If you have never seen a Kiarostami movie before, watch \"Ten\" instead. If you want some good Iranian movies, you may also try \"Sib\", aka \"The Apple\". This movie is divided in 5 parts, and only the fourth, featuring some funny ducks, is worth watching. If this is the first Iranian movie you see, you probably won\\'t want to see any more. I don\\'t blame you, but you will miss some great movies.'\n",

In fact,I can't stand this programme, if people like it that's fine, but as I believe in honesty, here's the bottom line... Down With Big Brother. I don't find it funny, quite the opposite, boring, tedious and a waste of time. And some of the contestants act disgracefully towards each other, if I had a choice of being a contestant on this programme and jumping out of a plane without a parachute,I'd know what I'd choose. The presenter Davina McCall is okay, but she can do so much better things with her life. Also most of the contestants have the likability of spinach and even worse in some cases, Big Brother does get my vote as having some of the most unlikeable characters on television. Even the theme tune I can't stand. Overall, a programme, like another reviewer summed up perfectly, that has limped past its sell by date, and should be taken off the air pronto. 1/10 Bethany Cox\"\n",
      " b'This movie is far better than the original The Jerk. I would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor. We have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from Monty Python.  The card game with the hobos and then with Mr. Suicide. The scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup. The original The Jerk was too choreographed ans staged. While I like Steve Martin, he seemed like he was trying to hard. The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone. The Jerk Too is family friendly unlike the original The Jerk.'\n",
      " b'Believe it or not this is a good movie. I don\\'t hate this at all. Why? It has horrific dialog, plot holes large enough so you can plow a cruise ship thorough, and not much going on in the plot department. I like this movie for its setting(so exotic, so alive, and up to date) In fact, so up to date that this is one of the first movies that had modern cellphones in them. Believe it or not the hero in this movie takes the damn bus! THE BUS!!! Sharon Stone and Slyvester Stallone make a great couple especially in \"sex in the hotel shower\" scene. Talk about chemistry. James Woods makes adds some hostility and a pulse to this melodrama with his wisecracks, outbursts, and foul-mouthed banter as the villain. But what\\'s with the late Rod Stieger and Eric Roberts fronting as Cuban mobsters? C\\'mon, here. The strange thing is, they make it work. The action sequences such as the Sly kicking ass and taking names while encountering a couple of thugs on a bus and throwing one out the window, a hotel room explodes and collapses into the ocean with the bad guys still in it, and the funky way Sly sets traps for the bad guys gives this movie redemption. However, the characters in question could\\'ve been a little bolder, a little more gunplay is needed, and I have a major beef with discrepancies in the May Munro story. She looks 35, now if her parents were killed when she was a little girl, shouldn\\'t Tomas be a tad older(he looked the same age in her flashback) The Specialist would\\'ve been a great movie if the plot was better explained and more intense.'\n",
      " b\"I watched this after taping it from an episode of IFC Grindhouse. It was so boring that I could barely stay awake watching it. Maybe it was because I have never smoked pot and never will that it didn't work for me on any level. It wasn't effective as propaganda or unintentional camp. I fast-forwarded it at some points just because I wanted to get to the ending.  Aside from the fact that I have never smoked pot and never will, maybe the fact that I saw it 72 years after it was made would explain why I found zero entertainment value. I applaud Dwain Esper for his hard work keeping the movie Freaks out of obscurity, but this movie just stunk.\"\n",
      " b'Eugene O\\'Neill\\'s 4 and a half hour 1927 play brought to the screen in less than two hours. The play\\'s combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama hasn\\'t aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it, especially Norma Shearer\\'s Nina and Ralph Morgan\\'s Marsden. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical musings of the others which better fits Gable\\'s range. Once the plot settles down to the love quadrangle and the audience adjusts to the voiceover asides the film does become more enjoyable. The technique used here for the asides is another problem. On stage the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience. Here they\\'re done as voiceovers. You\\'d think that would work better but since the action no longer freezes the actors are forced to pause speaking and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts. Plus it\\'s difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of Groucho Marx\\'s hilarious parody version in \"Animal Crackers.\" Added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for censorship reasons (Nina\\'s promiscuity is soft-peddled and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play) and a wretched score (uncredited) that sounds like background music to a turn-of-the-century weepie. O\\'Neill called this film \"a dreadful hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship,\" and although \"Strange Interlude\" is nowhere near as great as his later \"The Iceman Cometh\" and \"Long Day\\'s Journey Into Night,\" it certainly deserved better than this.'\n",
      " b'To most people this movie is about a small town in the South. To me that one small town street is the place where my husband and I used to day dreaming about buying antique furniture after he would finish graduate school at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, Florida. The movie location, the one street town of Micanopy, is just a few miles away from Gainesville. They show the entire downtown! As I have watched Doc Hollywood umpteen times, I love to see the corner store, which was a jewelry store called the Strawberry Bank specializing in antique jewelry about seventeen years ago. I would put stuff on lay-way as graduate students could not afford the luxury of buying something faster. Then we would drive around those back roads full of trees and Spanish moss and eat an early dinner: fried cat fish, fried okra, rice, and whatever fresh thing they had that our small stomachs could contain. It was such a great time in our lives! That area is surrounded by students. I guess we did not realize how little we had as graduate students, since we were even able to afford an off-campus apartment! Everybody else had about the same youth and enthusiasm and we were looking to our bright futures. I would go to the library and get books on antiques furniture, old lace and antique jewelry. I would audit French classes, take classes in jewelry making techniques: such as lost wax and casting. I learned so much about life in that town, and biked until I ended up tan without ever sitting in the sun.  \\tLike Michael J. Fox (The American President) \"Dr. Benjamin Stone,\" I was fascinated with the big city. Coming from one of the largest cities in the world, I just wondered what I was going to do after I finished my classes as a Visiting Student at the UF. Well after living there for about four years, I learned much more than what graduate school could ever teach. Like Dr. Stone, I fell in love with the place, I would not mind having a pig named Jasmine, I fell in love with the quilt making, the silence, the southern hospitality, and how \"they all\" thought I had an accent. I can even do a pretty good southern accent now myself! Every once in while a celebrity would come to town like Sally Fields (Forest Gump) raising support for a project that her brother a physics professor at UF was working on. Those college folk, they sure come up with strange ideas. That was so cool!  Julie Warner (Mr. Saturday Night) \"Lou\" was so adorable with her down to earth attitude. I loved to see the Mayor dressed like a squash. That is the South! This is an excellent movie. It has values. Ben Stone realized that being a Doctor in a small town might even mean having to read to your clients personal letters to them because they could not read. He in the end realizes that being needed is far more important than money. My favorite quotes: \" Watch your language Doc, you are in the belt of the Bible belt.\" Stone: \"There were cows in the middle of the road! I told you my insurance company will be happy to pay for that fence.\" Judge:\"I built that fence myself. Neither you, nor, your insurance company can pay for a fence that I built myself.\" My favorite scenes: the one street in Micanopy, the cute wooden cabin, the little old ladies quilting and arguing. Ben Stone and Lou driving around on that old huge ambulance, and acting like real animals demarcating their territories by scent. They would urinate and distribute the liquid around to detract deer that would attract the hunters. My husbands favorite scene is Julie Warner slowing rising from under water when she was skinny dipping. Not lewd, but enchanting. Well we are going to \"visit all \" the relatives down south and eat fresh catfish in some back road \"ma &pa restaurant.\" I guess \" you all\" have to go buy or rent this movie.'\n",
      " b'I would gladly give this show a 9 except that I can\\'t stand the Ulles.  This show is a masterpiece, traveling the globe, hitting as many fun points as they can pack in to a small TV segment. Watching it in HD makes you feel like you\\'re there and makes me want to travel so much more.  However, the husband/wife team that have been selected to follow leaves something to be desired. While I\\'m pretty sure they were selected to represent the \"typical\" traveler, that\\'s not entertaining on TV. I want my hosts to have some incite, some fun facts, interesting stories, deep reflection. The Ulles just think everything is \"amazing\" or \"cool\" or \"wow\". And the wife is afraid of heights, yet about half the things they do require heights and she just exclaims how scared she is every time...and how happy she was she ignored it after they\\'re done. Ugh. After the first 10 times you\\'d think she\\'d learn.  Ditch the boring unlovable couple and keep hitting amazing destinations.'\n",
      " b'I\\'ve just seen \"The Last Drop\". Honestly, I had to watch it twice to see the whole film, for it failed to pull me in like other wartime-movies usually do. Having seen so many excellent wartime-movies, my expectations were at the beginning fairly high. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed for \"The Last Drop\" is no match for great movies such as \"The Great Raid\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\". The film lacks tension and suspense, as it shifts from one scene to another, as well as professional acting to carry out a good quality performance. I agree with the rest of you who claim the accents being indescribable and improper for everyone seems to speak with his own variety of British accent. That\\'s just weird. To my opinion, the whole production of the movie is bad as the storyline loses thread and a viewer is thus left confused and rather disturb. On the other hand, putting in real footage makes the film a little bit more plausible and somehow makes up for the weak script reflected in excruciatingly poor dialogue. There is some ribald sense of humor to spice things up, yet not enough to bring characters into life. All in all, the scriptwriter and the producer of the film provide a viewer with low budget special effects, bad scenery and a sort of a mish-mash of old (jazz) and modern (rock!! :S ) soundtrack music. So, if you really do want to watch a wartime-movie, try to avoid this one and pick the miniseries \"Band Of brothers\" or one of the above mentioned movies instead.'\n",
      " b\"Asia Argento had an introduction to this movie, saying that she hopes people will understand her better or worse. One would hope that there is more to Argento than this movie shows. Her character is flat and, to be honest, really dumb. Anna meets a rock star and after knowing him for, maybe, a few hours, sleeps with him and tells him they made love. Then, she seems surprised when he tries to sneak out in the morning. Basically, that is it. An old man tapping a documentary tries to molest her, a film director tries to rape her, and some random blonde girl gets off on top of her. Then, shock of shocks, the rock star has a wife and doesn't love her. The most honest part of the movie was the introduction, where you can see the longing in her eyes as she asks you to enjoy her movie. It's the only interesting thing in this mess.\"\n",
      " b'First of all I am sorry for my poor English, I just want to say that the moral of this movie is just wrong, I would say stupid, the wife betrays her husband and he \"cuckold\" forgives her easily... No way, this is not real, so what is the moral then, I could not understand, I like Ben Affleck and enjoyed some parts of the movie where he says about his family and his father, these parts are good and makes people to think, moreover the movie is full of funny stories, however, the main idea and subject is totally wrong and this movie may cause some wives to betray their husbands, thinking their husbands will forgive them?! This movie can destroy normal families, I would not recommend to see it, it may mislead one, These are my opinion and I would glad to have any comments from you, my e-mail is: murod2000@yahoo.com sorry if I said something wrong and wish you and your families all the best...

      " b'I was excited for this when it came out. Directed by the person who brought us the underrated House On Haunted Hill, many horror movie veterans (Dorff, Combs, and Kier), and at the time a fresh concept (released just before the Ring and all the other \"ghost uses everyday thing to kill you\" movies), and a dark atmosphere. So movie starts to begin, things are mixed. Cool death scenes, but scares are nonexistent (and believe me, I\\'m a wuss at horror movies in the theater and jump at even the fake scares). Use of Rammstein song, major check! But then after the first major death scenes and Dorff decides to check out the website himself, the movie starts to go downhill. Maybe it was because of how confusing the movie got afterwards or my mind just doesn\\'t choose to remember it at all, or maybe even both but I can\\'t remember too much of what happens in the second half right until the predictable climax. The characters are just too uninteresting too, no matter who is playing them. It just ticked me off how Combs was given a crap role, and a small one too. OK, maybe he didn\\'t have a big one in HOHH, but he still owned a lot more than what he does here.  So in summary, I guess everyone has a few speed bumps in their career of movies. This is one for Malone, and I hope his next movie will make me bow at his feet and forgive him for the 5 bucks I wasted on this movie'\n",

We watched the movie through it\\'s entirety, but at the end of the movie we were both very disappointed in the movie. The movie itself was good - but just knowing that it was a continuation of Sara\\'s life, is what upset us over the movie. None of the original cast was in the second one (no one can take Julia Stiles place in that movie) and just the fact that everything that Sara and Derek went through in the first one just to be together - \"they\" decided to take a break from each other and date other people. The second one was a big let down. If the second one would have been about someone else\\'s life - it would have been a great movie - on it\\'s own.'\n",

      " b\"This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels).  The characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume, and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether. But as the story develops the two wives, trapped in loveless marriages, draw together. Drawing on the strength of their friendship and love, they give each other the courage to abandon their roles.  They have found that living within their traditions is no life at all, it is a sort of living death: without passion, without true connection to others, without fulfillment. Although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom, it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable, predictable existence.  The screenplay is wonderful, the acting marvelous. Near perfect!\"\n",

Although I guess a few of the British in-jokes (like calling two London characters Dixon and Winterburn, after Arsenal soccer players) may be lost on some, this is still cracking entertainment, which veritably pumps with vitality.  Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interplay between the two protagonists is always well-judged. In fact Scott's direction is very assured, considering that this is his first feature film, and proves that he has his father's talent for putting us at ease in unfamiliar surroundings.  Hell, I've convinced myself. I'm gonna see it again!\"\n",

It was the only film that he ever directed, and the reason is obvious.'\n",

      " b'\"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow\" appears to take place in a spotless netherworld, an era long gone by, where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket. It opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival, who pressures her into a car race. That\\'s about it for the drag-racing--this B-flick is mostly concerned with rock \\'n roll, man! The folks at American International were obviously fond of decent, square teens who liked to party and yet didn\\'t mind an adult chaperone. There are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges (Necking Kid: \"We thought we\\'d come out for some fresh air\"...Dad: \"Where did you think you\\'d find it, down her throat?\"), but the ghost is a little late in arriving. Brief at 65 minutes, the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off-screen and a pre-\"Scooby Doo\"-styled unmasking which makes no sense. However, for nostalgia buffs, some mindless fun. ** from ****'\n",

In fact, I'd love to spend it again and again and again on movies like this.... An absurd combination of humor, drama, thrill and the big questions. This is exactly what makes it a Great movie. Okay, some might not enjoy what they see, and some might even turn it off after a little while. your loss. It's got a wonderful way of dealing with the issues we've all been through in one way or the other, and the characters you think you won't enjoy the company of throughout the movie, turns out to be the ones you really come to love after a short while. For anyone with an open mind, and a sense of humor and living - watch this movie, I promise you you won't be disappointed!\"\n",
      " b\"One of the best movies I have seen in my life time! An absolute masterpiece from M Night Shyamalan. This film tells about a 10 year old boy Joshua A Beal's (Joseph Cross) quest for God after his grandfather's death.  The performance of the kids in this film were stunning especially Joshua's. I simply fell in love with this boy's innocent face and meaningful questions he asks. One of the best things in this film is the dialogues that were highly thoughtful and brilliant.  The running race scene in the school which involves Joshua's grandfather was a touching one where I couldn't control tears in my eyes. Other brilliant performers are Joshua's friend Dave, Robert (grandfather) and Sister Terry done by Rosie O'Donnell. This boy Joshua steals my heart, how could M Night Shyamalan brings out such a talent from his little heroes? Hats off Shyamalan, you were so unlucky this film didn't brought you laurels, in my view your best one.  The feeling you get when you watch the movie is warmth, heartening which will last for some time. The best part is the climax where I couldn't control crying\"\n",

If you take The Devil's Rejects and suck all the good out of it, and add a lot of twisted, kinky bondage parts, a few rape scenes, and like one or two sincerely horrifying scenes, and you'd get this movie. People are calling this a ripoff of '86's The Hitcher, but I don't see that at all. Even the worst Hitcher ripoffs are still better than this. The main problem on display here is that there's really nothing here besides a few of the director's fetishes being showcased like circus exhibits. Is all you need out of a movie shots of girls being abused and tied up, cowering in fear? Well, then rent this movie!  However, I'd rather just watch a good movie, which this is clearly not. The sad thing is, there are some really good thrills waiting to be uncovered here, but only a few. For instance, the suspense at the beginning before the bondage nonsense started...pretty damn good if you ask me. And the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl (can't remember names) is chilling, very brutal in a way, challenging even The Devil's Rejects for unbridled fury. How come the rest of the movie can't be that good? Huh? I really need to stop renting stupid crap like this. Closing message: Just let this gutter trash die and forget it forever. Not recommended.\"\n",

John Lennon was a fascist who supported the communist Russian, Chinese and North Vietnamese governments through personal and band proceeds from their shows. His support of the guerrilla movement of the vicious Black Panther's is covered but oddly enough it is glorified. Let's remember that the Black Panther's were one of the largest violent anti American groups during that time period. They shot, stabbed and beat people for disagreeing with their views and bombed businesses and government buildings. No surprises here, this is to be expected out of Hollywood.

This film is far more original than most of what comes out of Hollywood, and was one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year. Like all sci-fi, it does require suspension of disbelief to go along with the idea that one could see/interact with the past (and the technology that makes it possible), but once you've that single premise, Deja Vu is one of the most captivating films to come out in awhile. Most of the haters on this board seem to have gotten too twisted up in the plot turns and time travel to enjoy the film. This is not a movie that you'll want to walk away from for a few minutes without pausing, but if you pay attention through it all, you'll find that the conclusion is just about bulletproof, and you got more than your money's worth at the video store.\"\n",
      " b'The Jazz Singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940\\'s and 1950 about the Jewish experience in the United States. Other than Crossfire(1947) and Gentleman\\'s Agreement(1947) which dealt with anti-semitism they usually had a musical-theatre background. These films included The Jolson Story(1946), Jolson Sings Again(1949), The Eddy Duchin Story(1951), The Eddie Cantor Story(1953),The Benny Goodman Story(1956) and Margorie Morningstar(1958). The leading actors in these \"Jewish\" films were always played by non-Jews. For example Larry Parks a non-Jew played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme palpable to a mainly non-Jewish audience. The Jazz Singer(1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish although she plays a non-practicing Jewess in the film. The clue to her background is when she attends the Golding\\'s family meal before entering she says \"I haven\\'t been to a sader (passover service) since I left home\".  The film is about a cantor\\'s son who has just left the service after seeing action in Korea. His dilemma is whether to become a cantor, a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre. His choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father.  However, there is much more to this film than this. This film was made after the Rosenberg trial during the McCarthy whitchhunts and the Hollywood blacklist. Therefore in this film the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens and  are quintessentialy American. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. The cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a Major League umpire. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have visited. Therefore Jews are presented as part and parcel of American society. Nobody in this film has a Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this film you get to see her sing \"Lover\" and \"Just One of Those Things\" wonderful. Danny Thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well. The comedic routines could have been left out. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing. I enjoyed it very much.'\n",
      " b\"A surprisingly good warmovie.  It has realistic battle scenes, competent acting plus it shows the Vietnam war from the medics' and doctors' point of view. The romance was believable and Cheryl Ladd was always a decent actress (and good-looking).  Battle scene highlights: the NVA assault on a USMC firebase. Those Marines' bloodlust was on a par with the NVA's!  I don't like chicks' movies, or *romantic* movies. I do agree however, that nearly all warmovies need a healthy dose of realistic romance. 'Purple Hearts' provides us with just that.\"\n",
      " b'I have seen many - possibly too many straight-to-video, no budget slasher films and have developed a taste for the \"good ones\", or the ones that are less sucky, as ridiculous as that sounds, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER, is what I kindly like to refer to as... absolute crap. Nothing about it is enjoyable - the acting sucks, the characters suck, the killer sucks, the gore is minimal... and sucks. It is about a group of college friends who drive out to a newly discovered family cabin, owned by the parents of one of the kids. It is meant to be a relaxing retreat, but little do they know that a deathly ill former plastic surgeon-gone bad, along with his two female assistants, search for usable tissue to save the doctor. His name is Dr. Chopper since he rides around on a motorcycle and of course, chops. This is just a terrible movie, not worthy of anyone\\'s time. Enough said.'\n",
      " b'I love that UNLIKE movies like \"Snow White\" and \"Sleeping Beauty,\" the main characters in this movie don\\'t fall in love by first glance. They get to know each other and fall in love gradually. Not like in \"Snow White\" where Snow White and Prince Charming fall in love because they both think that the other is hot. That sort of thing doesn\\'t happen in real life, if someone in real life loved someone else without even knowing their name. I\\'de feel really, really, really bad for that couple. And the movie has great music and songs, most of the characters are lovable. And it\\'s just a great movie. It\\'s definitely a Disney classic that you have to watch.'\n",
      " b'The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people. (as MST3k Commentary states it...\"Sanata has the dirt on every! Santa\\'s Tentacles reach far and wide! There is no hiding from the Klaus Organization\")  From telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything. Its amazing that the CIA doesn\\'t have Santa on the payroll.   Satan\\'s dance routine is hilarious. Pitch...he is so useless.  The cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous. Very low budget but so fun to watch. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version for even more laughs.  You even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids.  I give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.'\n",
      " b'The title pretty much lets you know what you\\'re getting. It\\'s a grade-C howler but not as blatantly funny as I was hoping. Directed by exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing \"Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Philadelphia\"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the Philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. Playing hooker and small-time drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women\\'s prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. Run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as Lee and Karen are pitted against each other. Of course, they escape but shackled together a la \"The Defiant Ones\" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.  Meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for Lee who stole $40K from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen\\'s panties and some of the worst of 1970\\'s men\\'s fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what\\'s truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Sadly, Grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the \"jive\", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde whom I am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. Since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra.'\n",
      " b\"This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema \\xc2\\x96 a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle. The fact that it is kids who are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable. Fulci is pushing the envelope a bit here and he goes even further in a gloriously outrageous unPC scene where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman (Barbara Bouchet) who he is tasked with delivering a drink to. She displays herself openly and actively invites the youngster to ogle her; ultimately asking him if he wants to go to bed with her. Although she is clearly playing around with him, it's still quite an unusual scene. Admittedly there are one or two unintentionally funny bits of dialogue here but it's very nicely photographed and Barbara Bouchet exudes high levels of confident sex-appeal. A standout scene. Even if you might feel slightly wrong watching it!  Along with Barbara Bouchet, the other standout performance is from Florinda Bolkan, who plays a madwoman who is accused of murdering the children. She is not directly responsible but it is left to the viewer to decide whether her black magic may or may not have kicked off the subsequent killing spree. Irrespective, she is hunted down by a lynch mob and chain-whipped while a car radio blasts out rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. Its viciousness indicates the path Fulci's career would subsequently go.  Despite the visceral impact of the above murder it's maybe a little surprising that the other killings are either bloodless or committed off-screen. The only other death scene comparable with the lynch-mob is the demise of the killer at the end of the movie, although this sequence is kind of silly. The plot is convoluted and awash with red herrings, although personally, I found the identity of the killer a little predictable. This weakness is less problematic on subsequent viewings though \\xc2\\x96 like most gialli, Don't Torture A Duckling is eminently re-watchable.  Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani \\xc2\\x96 particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill. Fulci obviously went on to make more graphically violent horror movies but here he shows a talent for slightly more restrained material. It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.\"\n",
      " b'Strangely erotic schlock Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans the world over. Appears to be an interesting take on \"Beauty and the Beast\". It is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era.  Corsets, castles, rutting horses, rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods, proof that no-one had a Brazilian in the 70\\'s, and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at, what more could you possibly want?!  It certainly brightened my Sunday afternoon!'\n",
      " b\"I first saw this film when it aired on the now defunct Trio Channel a few years ago, and recently watched it again--sans commercials--on Sundance. I was impressed the first time, and found it even more engaging on second viewing. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect--Amos Gitai's hysterical commentary stands out like a sore thumb--but taken collectively, 11 09 01 is a total success. Best of show: Shohei Imamura's amazing final segment, which contemporary critics such as the thick-witted Mick LaSalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on 'the terrorists', but now stands revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic; Samira Makhmalbaf's opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for the children of Afghanistan; and Idrissa Ouedraogo's amusing children's crusade for Osama Bin Laden--a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the REAL Osama. Youssef Chahine's segment is a noble if failed experiment which at least has the guts to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of American foreign policy and the CIA, and though Sean Penn's character study seems out of place, it's still an effectively bittersweet piece of film-making. All in all, essential viewing, and a darn sight better than Oliver Stone's reactionary World Trade Center.\"\n",
      " b'I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film. Like other neo-Biblical films of the 1940\\'s and 50s, \"The Egyptian\" reflects the morals and values of that time, but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told.'\n",
      " b\"Kurosawa is a proved humanitarian. This movie is totally about people living in poverty. You will see nothing but angry in this movie. It makes you feel bad but still worth. All those who's too comfortable with materialization should spend 2.5 hours with this movie.\"\n",

If you want laughs, Norm and Dave Chapelle deliver them in bucket loads. Don't look for any great directing or Oscar worthy acting, but this movie without a doubt received ten stars from me. Devito does a great job in a hilarious supporting role. The movie takes you through a lot of twists and turns but it delivers.\"\n",
      " b'This rates as high as it does for me because of the cinematography. It is dazzling and Blanchett can\\'t be denied, but \"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\" is like a chick-flick with explosions plus costumes, super hair, and loud, intrusive music. The result is faux epic.  My wife summed it up well as we left the theater: \"I feel like I\\'ve just flipped through a coffee table picture book for two hours and somebody turned up the stereo.\" History wrote this plot but Nicholson and Hirst thought they could do better. They couldn\\'t, or certainly didn\\'t. Freshmen composition classes come up with better stuff. Trite, forced, predictable. Did they even run this by an expert in English history? You gotta wonder. The script is oozing with 21st century mores and clich\\xc3\\xa9s. It made me think (during the movie, mind you) of the way Dutch painters depicted Homer and Aristotle in the garb of 17th century Holland. Are we that dumb? Sir Walter Raleigh is a caricature and Sir Francis Drake, never properly introduced, was a throwaway. Geoffrey Rush is wasted as Walsingham. Come to think of it, nearly everybody is wasted. Every single character is underdeveloped, with the possible exception of the title character\\xc2\\x97possible exception.  \"Golden Age\" set the target high and then turned and fired in the opposite direction. Realizing the script had missed, Director tried to make up for it with window dressing. Substance would have served this queen better. With the colon in the title, I almost expected to see Bruce Willis saving the day.  You can see why \"Golden Age\" came out in October because it\\'s not going to compete for Oscars in categories that anybody cares about. With all the budget they had for this movie, you\\'d Universal could have found better writers.'\n",
      " b'The promise of Martin Donovan playing Jesus was, quite honestly, enough to get me to see the film. Definitely worthwhile; clever and funny without overdoing it. The low-quality filming was probably an appropriate effect but ended up being a little too jarring, and the ending sounded more like a PBS program than Hartley. Still, too many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge it harshly.'\n",
      " b'Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I\\'ve seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.  Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings? Does any of this matter when faced with the sheer sumptuousness of the visuals and the sly humour of the characters. Any battle for my heart was won once I saw the main protagonist dressed as spider-man - awesome! Many people will complain about a lack of story cohesion but for a fun movie to laugh about with a bunch of mates you can\\'t do better, especially if you do an alcoholic shot every time someone says \"I will love you 10,000 years\".'\n",
      " b'(Spoilers)  I was very curious to see this film, after having heard that it was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt.  The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole film were two things.  First of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if, by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and dull.  Secondly, the overall sloppiness of the production, with dialogues that were barely understandable.  Too bad.'\n",
      " b'WOW! First time I saw this movie in 1993 I was in Kindergarten. I remember the day my mom bought the movie for me when it came out on VHS and I just couldn\\'t stop watching it! Still to this day I still can\\'t stop watching it! The Secret Garden is the most beautiful movie ever made-in every aspect. It\\'s one of \"me and my mommy\\'s favorite movies\"!. This movie is so great, it even has it\\'s own copy-cat movie(*Cough* LITTLE PRINCESS *cough!*...don\\'t get me wrong, I do like the movie though).

I would give you a summary, but I\\'d ruin the whole story!! If you want me to, drop me an e-mail asking about The Secret Garden and I\\'ll ruin it for you. Believe me, you\\'ll wanna plan your own Garden.  Since alot of people are adding it, I\\'ll add mine as well... Favorite Part: When Mary, Collin and Dickon are in the garden together and Collin learns how to walk for the first time. Also when Collin comes face to face with his father for the first time!!  This movie shouldn\\'t stay a Secret! I give it a 10 out of 10'\n",
      " b'Blatantly profane, smarmy attempt at a comedy, dealing with the uber-intense plot of a slovenly softball team trying not to get kicked out of their league. Perhaps if I grew up back east, where apparently close friends engage in non-stop insults of each other, their wives, and even small children. Or more importantly, was still a 14-year-old boy who could delight in laughing through a cupped hand at the hardcore sexual references. Maybe I\\'d be singing praises from a rooftop somewhere. Instead, I stared embarrassingly at the amateurish mess in front of me.  I\\'m sure the target audience will cherish their dvds, but the limited release is the tell-tale of how unacceptable this is to most crowds. It borders on the same humor that made \"Virgin\" and \"Anchorman\" hits, but those films --- though I hated them --- at least limited their vulgarity. This film just purposely goes for the throat in terms of tastelessness and constant four-letter dialogue.   It was good to see Macchio again (you could tell he asked that his cuss-words be kept to a minimum), and even Seymour Cassel play against type. But the casual nature of tossed off lines dealing with ejaculation and bj\\'s was utterly desperate. And must we see another implausible romance between a hot slut and a greasy pudge? It\\'s getting old. Did I mention the stripper that can launch ping-pong balls from her vagina? Nuff said.'\n",
      " b\"I, too, saw this film at the Berlinale, and though the matter of rape was treated with maturity and frankness, the film itself was constructed poorly. More than anything, it was bland - camera placement and cuts were standard fare, non-diagetic sound was near non-existent, and the dialogue was highly unrealistic, comprising of long, drawn-out pauses interspersed with briefly-spoken lines.  The upshot of this was that I felt no attachment to the characters beyond a basic sympathy for their current predicaments - dialogue was stretched out to the point of losing its emotional resonance, and many lines were delivered with little feeling from the actors. I was particularly unconvinced by Sabine Timoteo's performance, whose talent restricted her to screaming rather than actual crying. Compared to Claire Dane's stunning depiction of anguish in Romeo and Juliet, I felt wholly unsatisfied by her performance.  It was these factors that made the characters feel less than human, failing to imbue them with life. This, coupled with the utterly bland direction and editing, meant that I felt no attachment to them, and I was left gagging for each coming line of dialogue purely to provide a break from the silent, expressionless moments in between. Drawing out the narrative to over two and a half hours simply rubbed salt in the wound.  The Free Will was not in itself awful, but there were so few points of interest that I found myself becoming restless within forty minutes, and when the credits rolled in what will doubtless be considered a brilliantly emotional finale, I still felt little attachment to the characters.\"\n",
      " b'What a waste. I was hoping for this film to recreate the kind of claustrophobic terror that was the only reason to watch the first film, but instead, the entire film is an excuse for Jennifer Love Hewitt to show off her body. The plot is so pathetic it\\'s not even worth mentionning; ditto for the script, characters, settings, acting, directing, production values... Brandy Norwood\\'s \"performance\" here wasn\\'t even worth the money it cost to the producers to fly her to L.A. for a meeting to ask her to star. Her dialogue doesn\\'t make her character seem very stupid, but since she is, she makes everytihng and everyone around her look and act dumb, but once she\\'s gone, they all seem smart. Only Matthew Settle brings any minimal charm to his character, but he does have a lot of the script\\'s worst lines. The mentionned third entry in this series, once again featuring Ben Willis, will confirm this series the 1990s equivalent to \"Friday the 13th\"... People will be going to see these movies to see who gets mangled, and how badly, not for plot, suspense, character, etc... Grade: F'\n",
      " b'I think that this film was one of Kurt Russels good movies. Kurt russel is my favorite actor so I think that he is a good actor in any role he plays. But this movie had a lot of action in it and I know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie. Oh well I thought it was good so I think that every one should see this movie. If you see this movie and like it I think that you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russel.

This film is the exact opposite of everything a good movie is. Nukie is painful enough to make small children cower in the corner for days and make grown men weep. I watched this film with my little brother and we had to stop 30 minutes in because he was literally getting sick to his stomach. By all means, if you watch this movie do NOT watch it alone or in the vicinity of sharp objects. This film is only for those who are brave of heart. Therapy may be needed after viewing.'\n",
      " b\"What a load of Leftist Hollywood bilge. This movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles. The fairytale ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, actually getting promoted for his treason. What is it with these Hollywood tools? Is this still payback for McCarthyism?  If I sound cynical it's because I am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda. The military brass in this movie are portrayed as, what else? Gung-ho war mongers. Sound familiar? Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about it. Yet again, Crimson Tide stresses the point. The Hackman character, U-boat captain Ramsey, comes across like a raving lunatic, until the very end when, of course he comes to his senses, does a complete 360, renounces his blood lust, suggests a promotion for the treasonous Ron Hunter, and repents by retiring from the service. A guy mutinies, takes command of your boat, puts the U.S at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first-strike, and you promote him???? What hogwash!\"\n",

Bad CGI, bad screenplay, bad story, bad acting, bad dialog, bad characterisation. Generally bad but with a redeeming 'it's so bad it's good vibe'.  Great for a comedown Sunday when you're brain is shot to bits, but that's it.  Check out the polystyrene snow that seems to brain everyone every five minutes. Maybe it's so easy as they're brains are so weak and tiny.  Ben\"\n",
      " b'It would have been easy for John Carpenter to stay in George Romero\\'s shadow or remain a cult figure with more \"Dark Star\"-type entertainment. Instead, JC catapulted his name and franchise into history with the release of EFNY. It contains all the classic elements: a no-compromise anti-hero (Russell), a cast of misfit cohorts who work both for and against his goals (Borgnine, Barbeau, Stanton), an enemy with real dimensions (Hayes), a fantastic and depressingly realistic setting (Manhattan turned into a prison), and an authority we can both respect (van Cleef) and despise (Pleasance). And all of it works extremely well with a no-nonsense plot and storyline. No part of this is so far-fetched that we can\\'t relate to the situation (and who hasn\\'t pictured NYC in this condition one day?) or sympathize with Russell\\'s character Snake Plissken. The worse thing you could say about this cult favorite is the low-key climax. No, you don\\'t get a major battle or explosions as the finale. What you do get is absolutely true-to-form with the rest of the film: Snake walks away after successfully completing his mission (and saving his own skin) and yet can still screw the authority and the society that put him in the situation to begin with...and you find yourself grinning in approval.'\n",
      " b'I just finished watching season three on GSN. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I absolutely hated seeing Zach and Flo cross the finish line first. Every dime of that money should go to Zach for keeping his cool and not smothering Flo in her sleep. That girl has to be the whiniest, most annoying person that I\\'ve ever seen on TV. She threatened to quit nearly a dozen times! I was hoping that Zach would knock her upside the head with one of the paddles during the water challenge in the second to last episode. Maybe that would get her to shut the hell up.  Flo is a horrible person who I hope Zach seriously distanced himself from after the race. But knowing him, they\\'re probably still best friends.

      " b'Filmed in 1975 as \"Sunburst\" until it was released on VHS in the eighties retitled \"Slashed Dreams\" to take advantage of Robert Englund\\'s popularity during the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" craze, this seventy-four minute exercise in hiking and rape is an absolute waste of film and can\\'t even be saved by the curvaceous Kathrine Baumann\\'s wasted nude scenes. Written by Stacy Keach\\'s brother James, who will always be Deputy Halik from \"Moving Violations\" to me, \"Slashed Dreams\" is about two life long friends, Jenny and Robert, who go hiking into the wilderness of Northern California to visit their mutual friend Michael played by Robert Englund who doesn\\'t show himself until the final twenty minutes of the film. Why going to see Michael is so important to Jenny and Robert is never explained only that Jenny really wants to see him. Fair enough. The first forty-five minutes consists of the two traveling north and hiking through the woods. Sound like fun? It isn\\'t. Nothing significant happens at all so why film any of this? While Jenny and Robert go skinny dipping they are spied on by two token hillbilly mountain boys Danker and writer/actor James Keach as Levon. Once the pair set their sites on Jenny\\'s pair, well, what do you think goes through their minds? Later that night they return to rape Jenny. Enter Michael who says little and provides next to nothing as far as support except for some hippie rambling about \"driving the devil out of your house\". Way to counsel Freddy Krueger. Robert tries to redeem himself by fighting the rapists but, no shock here, he doesn\\'t succeed. Afterwards Jenny comes to the realization that all is well. End of movie. What?   If this summary doesn\\'t stop you from watching this mess than let me deliver the dagger to your heart in the form of Roberta Van Dere. Who is she you ask? She\\'s responsible for singing all of the songs on the soundtrack and by singing I mean tone deaf caterwauling that is so annoying that I attempted to drive pencils into my ear canals. Her singing is so bad it defies belief that someone listened to her and said \"you should do this professionally\". Every song sounds exactly the same even her inappropriate howling following Jenny\\'s rape. A cat thrown into a dryer would have sounded better than her. Do yourself a favor a leaf through and old Reader\\'s Digest rather than waste your time on this crap.'\n",
      " b'No redeeming value. A cheap piece of trash that bears the same resemblance to the books by LeGuin as a Ford Pinto does to a pinto stallion. Everyone involved in this production should be ashamed.  The producers were clearly looking for a way to rip off Harry Potter and/or the Lord of the Rings when they stumbled upon this venerable series of fantasy books. Obviously they were just looking for a \"brand name\" to slap onto their uninspired swords-and-sorcery tale. To get the Earthsea stories to fit this mold, they have stripped out everything original, worthwhile and challenging about the original books. It\\'s not even clear the screenwriters read the original books, they appear to have written down the character names and geographical features and started from there.'\n",

I recently Viewed a Promo DVD of \"EDDIE MONROE\" and everything from the cast to the storyline and directing all worked smoothly. (Doug Brown\\'s Music Score was sensational.) I enjoyed seeing Frank Sivero (\"Goodfellas\", \"New York, New York\" and \"The Wedding Singer\"), he is an amazing and very underrated actor.But I especially liked the performance of Paul Vario who played Uncle Benny, I looked up his acting credits on the IMDb and I found out this was his first starring role. Where has this guy been! Give Fred Carpenter credit for discovering Great New Talent, it\\'s only a matter of time you\\'ll be seeing this guy costarring with Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned Carpenter knows how to entertain and when your working with a limited budget it is amazing what Carpenter can Produce.(I read the VENT MAGAZINE interview and Carpenter has never made a movie for more than $400,000.00 dollars.) Before I watched \"EDDIE MONROE\" I saw \"Rocky Balboa\" and \"The Good Shepherd\" both great films. \"Eddie Monroe\" took me on a ride to a surprised ending because of a very good script, good performances from the entire cast(Craig Morris is a movie star waiting to happen and the lead Actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) great Cinematography, Direction and Doug Brown\\'s Music Score. As I stated I recently seen \"Rocky Balboa\" and \"The Good Shepherd\", if I were to write a comment about those two movies I would be saying some of the same things I have stated about \"EDDIE MONROE\", the only thing those two very good films don\\'t have in common with \"Eddie Monroe\", they didn\\'t cost a few hundred grand.

      " b\"Michael and Mark Polish have created a truly heartwarming film. I sat glued to the TV as I watched this video. My heart sank when ignorant folks would stare or respond to the twins as though they didn't already know they were different than the rest of the world. Or when folks wanted to use them to get rich.  Seeing the love between the two brothers was so touching I had to get out a box of tissues when it came time for the surgeons to separate them.  Michele Hicks, her performance was awesome. She portrayed a true friend to both Blake and Frances, and a beautiful lover to Blake.  Lesley Ann Warren - what can I say - you were magnificent. Your performance as the mother who was haunted by giving up her children was heartbreaking. Making amends is not always easy and in the case of your character, a very difficult scene to act.  To the rest of the cast - I don't have enough room to write - you were all great!  I give this movie a 10. It deserves more, but that's the highest I can vote.  Thank you Michael and Mark Polish and all of the other actors, actresses, producers, directors, special effects, make-up artists, musicians, etc. that created one of the centuries best films.  \"\n",
      " b\"I'm stunned. I just finished watching this movie, and can't believe 1) how incredible it was; 2) that I knew nothing about this film, and that it is a totally hidden forgotten overlooked minor classic. I thought I knew or had heard of every major or almost-major film from the mid 30s through the 50s, but this came as a shock. There's no point comparing it to White Heat, which is in a class all by itself, for some justifiable memorable moments, notably the finale on the oil tank. But removing that legendary scene from the equation, this film is almost as good, with many scenes that stand out. The casting is flawless, and it has its own specialness, not the least (besides an always-brilliant Cagney), are the two love-interests, both pitch-perfect - Barbara Payton as the corrupted blonde, Helene Carter is the rich spoiled debutante. Notably, the script is devoid of clich\\xc3\\xa9, often surprising, witty and anachronistically violent following the pathological gangster Cagney on a lawless tear as he breaks out of prison and afterwards. Two scenes, among many, jump out from the norm for their style, as often happened in a Hitchcock film: Payton throwing coffee, sugar, etc at Cagney, during a spat; and Cagney pushing Carter's foot further on the pedal in a duel of power while she drives her sportscar. The movie was complete surprise, and quite wonderful.\"\n",

Great stories, twists and the way it was shot - to the untrained eye (not that mine is trained) can be miss-interpreted as being ropey but it adds to the films absorption of the audience. With the green hillsides and the contrast of the lush sunny lit forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles - Its great. Personally the definitive interpretation of the Robin Hood legend. I cannot stress how much i think you should watch this, if you get a chance then YOU MUST WATCH IT.\"\n",
      " b\"Two sailors are on leave--ladies man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and both fall in love with her. There's more but you've probably guessed it.  The story (even for a 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome--gets annoying pretty quick. Also this movie is far too long. It's 140 minutes and that's way too much for such a silly story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. Still this is worth catching.  When Kelly is dancing or Sinatra or Grayson are singing this becomes magical. None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice you won't care. It's shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss MGM had. The acting is OK--Kelly is fine (although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it) and Sinatra is just great (although seeing HIM as a shy guy was pushing it too!). Grayson is given nothing to do but she's incredibly beautiful to look at. Some shots of her literally took my breath away! There are plenty of highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly's big dancing and singing number; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry--an animated mouse! Tom does a funny cameo too. Also there's little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he's in.  So it's too long and the plot just doesn't hold up but it's still worth catching. This was a huge hit in its day.\"\n",
      " b'\"Crime Wave\" is a slick little \"B\" thriller that has been rediscovered recently. Directed by Andre De Toth, it\\'s a neat little \"film noire\" that has become a classic of sorts. It was filmed in 1952 but not released until 1954 and then came out on the bottom half of a double bill. It runs a scant 73 minutes but contains all of the dark shadows, special lighting and plenty of night scenes common in films of this genre. It was filmed entirely in 1952 Los Angelis except for a few process rear projection \"in car\" shots.  Three criminals, Doc Penny (Ted De Corsia), Ben Hastings (Charles Bronson aka Buchinsky) and Gat Morgan (Nedrick Young) are on a crime wave, robbing gas stations and small businesses. The film opens at a gas station where Gus Snider (Dub Taylor) is the night clerk. Morgan slugs snider but a passing cop suspects trouble and stops. Morgan shoots the cop but gets shot himself. Hastings makes sure of the cop.  Penner gives Morgan some money and tells him to go to the apartment of Steve Lacey (Gene Nelson) a former in-mate acquaintance to await Dr. Hessler (Jay Novello), a de-frocked physician who will help him. Lacey and his wife Ellen (Phyllis Kirk) want no part of this for fear that Steve will be drawn back into a life of crime. Just before Dr. Hessler arrives Morgan dies.  Meanwhile, back at the scene of the crime, Police Lt. Sims (Sterling Hayden) begins his investigation. He rounds up all of the usual suspects in the hope of learning where the criminals have gone. He narrows it down to Lacey\\'s apartment. He goes to Lacey\\'s apartment and begins to badger Steve and Ellen believing that once a crook always a crook.  Later, Penner and Hastings turn up at the apartment and threaten Ellen with harm unless Steve plays along with their plans to rob a bank. They then go to Penner\\'s hideout where Sully (Mack Chandler) and the psycho Johnny Haslett (Timothy Carey) await them. They finalize their plans and plan to leave Ellen behind with Haslett as insurance that Steve will do his part.  They go to the bank where Sully cuts the power and.................................................  Sterling Hayden is excellent as the seedy determined cop. With his rumpled suit, uneven tie, tooth pick and imposing 6\\'5\" frame, he makes an intimidating figure. Gene Nelson, who was a song and dance man, impresses in a rare dramatic role. Although there\\'s no \"femme fatale\" to speak of, Phyllis Kirk\\'s Ellen comes a across as a wife in control of her husband.  The rest of the cast is made up of established and recognizable character actors. Except for Bronson, most had been around for years and make excellent foils for the leading players. And watch for Iris Adrian and Fritz Feld being questioned at police headquarters and Hank Worden as Lacey\\'s boss.  It\\'s great to see Warner Bros. bringing back these lost little classics. This film and nine other films are included in \"Film Noire Volume 4\" on DVD.'\n",
      " b\"Okay, okay, maybe not THE greatest. I mean, The Exorcist and Psycho and a few others are hard to pass up, but The Shining is way up there. It is, however, by far the best Stephen King story that has been made into a movie. It's better than The Stand, better than Pet Sematary (if not quite as scary), better than Cujo, better than The Green Mile, better the Dolores Claiborne, better than Stand By Me (just barely, though), and yes, it's better than The Shawshank Redemption (shut up, it's better), I don't care WHAT the IMDb Top 250 says.   I read that, a couple of decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie, and from the other room, his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration. Finally, she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours, and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something (I tell this with all due respect, of course), she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand, and the book was The Shining. And thank God, too, because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever.  Stephen King can be thanked for the complexity of the story, about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing. Jack Nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as Jack Torrance (how many movies has Jack been in where he plays a character named Jack?), as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines (`Heeeeeere's Johnny!!'). Shelley Duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to Jack's desires to kill her. Stanley Kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch, and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls.  One of the most significant aspects of this movie, necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect, is the isolation, and it's presents flawlessly. The film starts off with a lengthy scene following Jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter. This is soon followed by the same thing following Jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel. This time the scene is intermixed with shots of Jack, Wendy, and Danny talking in the car, in which Kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of TV, as Wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of Danny, who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on TV (`See? It's okay, he saw it on the television.').  The hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place, and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge, echoing rooms and the long hallways. These rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel, but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie, and Kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel. Early in the film, there is a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his Big Wheel (is that what those are called?), and his relative speed (as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner. And being a Stephen King story, you EXPECT something to jump out at you. I think that the best scene in the halls (as well as one of the scariest in the film) is when Danny is playing on the floor, and a ball rolls slowly up to him. He looks up and sees the long empty hallway, and because the ball is something of a child's toy, you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him. Anyway, you get the point. The Shining is a damn scary movie.  Besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck, The Shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed. HAD Jack always been there, like Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really at that ball in 1921, or is that just someone who looks exactly like him? If he has always been the caretaker, as Mr. Grady also said, does that mean that it was HIM that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters, and not Mr. Grady, after all? It's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied, that's just mediocre filmmaking. For example, The Amityville Horror, which obviously copied much of The Shining as far as its subject matter, did this. But it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think (as mostly all of Kubrick's movies are). One more thing that we can all thank Stanley Kubrick for, and we SHOULD thank him for, is for not throwing this book against the wall. That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.\"\n",
      " b\"a scarily real drama, there isn't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has, the characters are not your typical Islamic terrorist, you have a blonde haired, blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks, he is a converted Muslim. A well respected business man, who pretends to be Jewish and a Frenchman who has converted to Islam, but has clearly taken the word of the Koran to a whole new level. The hero of the plot is Darwyn, who is an undercover FBI agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell, and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being detected. The first episode is a small taste of what's to follow. Although it is about Islamic terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all Muslims are extremists, which is comforting to those concerned with racism, considering half the terrorist cell are Islam converts, it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of. The most chilling drama I've ever seen. The reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends, your husband or your neighbours really are. Terrorists can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.\"\n",
      " b\"WOW...  This is without doubt one of the most HUMAN films I have ever seen.  A totally gripping and tragic tale of Fools falling in Love... Only to fall out of it again... TRAGICALLY...  I'm a man, who is NOT afraid to admit that he cried at the end of this film... It was THAT moving... And I'm guessing that if you are one that feels... Or has felt... REAL emotion in your life... Then you'll be moved by this movie too... Perhaps to tears.  The performances are excellent... Perfectly portraying the complexities, contradictions and 'perversions'... If one can call it that... Of the Human heart and spirit.  I seriously felt ashamed to be a man!!! And for once, a movie has made me really think what it must have been like to be a woman who is hopelessly in love with a total bast**d!!! I've never seen so many broken, sad and confused characters in one film before... And the interplay between them is moving and captivating...  Be warned however... This is a serious movie about love, lust and obsession. It is VERY dark on the emotional level, and has NO happy endings... A bit like REAL life perhaps...? So, if you are not yet emotionally mature and have not yet had your heart broken... Or have yet to break any hearts yourself (which is where I'm coming from... Yes, I AM ashamed!!!)... Then I don't think this film is for you...  This film is SO far removed from your usual Hollywood bulls**t, in that it depicts REAL Human emotions on a non superficial level... So stay well clear if you're just looking for a movie to chill out to...  You won't chill out to this one... It sucks you in, bleeds you dry and shatters that age old myth that 'Love Conquers All'...  'Cos take it from me... As this film shows... Love is FAR from perfect...  It's NOT a great movie... But given its very moving emotional content and realism on the portrayal of Human Beings...  I give it 9 / 10.\"\n",
      " b\"This is one of the best films I have ever seen! How anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination! First of all, Gooding's and Harris's performances were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. That is the only way I can describe the acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off; then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, since it was based on a true person, it goes where the lives of the characters go. For all the action buffs, it might be a little slow, but then it's not an action film. I definitely give this movie a 10. It deserves nothing less!\"\n",
      " b\"That's what I kept asking myself while watching this film. I mean the amount of nudity and sex was one thing but another part of the movie which gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of storyline. Really I just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie, but I persisted. I persisted in the hope that maybe the storyline would get better, that there might be a good twist at the end. However I couldn't have been more wrong. In the end I persisted because I figured I could write a bad review for it if anything after watching it.   I mean don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director only shows that along with a shitty story thinking it's what the viewer wants to see, it insults us all. To think we are all so shallow to only want to see burlesque from rep ratable, big movie industry players is preposterous. My advice: hire a different movie.\"\n",
      " b\"I was in college in Laramie, Wyoming, at the time of the Matthew Shepard tragedy, and will always be ashamed that such a crime could have taken place in my community. With that said, this movie gets it all wrong. They went for easy plot devices, the furthering of stereotypes (which shouldn't be Matthew's legacy), and a misrepresentation of the community. The sad part is that with a little work, they could have made a film that sent a lasting message. Instead they made a movie that portrayed a town full of simple minded rednecks who somehow have Southern accents, a police force consisting of a Barney Fife cop, and a total reinvention of certain parts of the story. Being that the idiots that murdered Matthew came from Laramie, examining the responsibility of the community is fair, but this isn't examination. This is lazy story telling that MTV unfortunately passed off as an educational film (They used to show it late at night without commercials as part of their Cable in the Classroom series so educators could tape it). If you want to see the definitive movie (or play) on the Matthew Shepard tragedy, see The Laramie Project. That movie doesn't let anyone off the hook. It doesn't look for easy answers, and it gives the subject matter the true examination it deserves.\"\n",
      " b'\"Dracula vs Frankenstein\" has got to rank near the top of the all-time worst films list. A cheap independent quickie obviously meant for the drive-in circuit, its only redeeming grace are the many down on their luck veteran performers in the cast.   J. Carroll Naish, confined to a wheelchair, plays yet another relative of the original Dr. Frankenstein called Dr. Durea. He and his mute assistant Groton (Lon Chaney Jr.) are still at it, murdering unsuspecting young girls for experimentation from their secret location in a House of Horrors located in an amusement park. Into the mix comes Count Dracula (Zandar Vorkov) who promises to revive the famous monster (John Bloom) in return for the evil doctor\\'s help in developing a serum to make Dracula invincible. Heroine Judith Fontaine (Regina Carrol) enters the picture looking for her missing sister. She is aided in her search by hero Anthony Eisley and cop Jim Davis. Along the way she encounters evil biker Russ Tamblyn. Even famed magazine publisher Forest J. Ackerman appears proving that he should have stuck to magazines.   Well you would think with such a cast of seasoned veterans the picture would have been better. I hate to think what it would have been without their participation. The acting other than from Naish, Chaney, Davis and Eisley is just plain dreadful. Carrol who must have been the producer\\'s girlfriend, is just plain awful. Vorkov as Dracula is laughable and the Frankenstein monster\\'s face looks like a roasted marshmallow. The \"climatic\" battle between Dracula and the monster is a hoot, when you can see it in the poorly lit setting.    The production \"values\" of this film are non-existent. And it\\'s really sad to see such veteran performers as Naish and Chaney (in the final film for both) involved in such nonsense. Tamblyn, who had once been a rising star at MGM in the 50s is embarrassingly bad. Eisley and Davis both do what they can with weak direction and material.   \"Dracula vs Frankenstein\" was a sad end for two fine actors. Unfortunately, they ended up much the same way as their contemporaries Karloff and Lugosi, appearing in god-awful Grade Z movies at the end of their careers. They all deserved better.'\n",
      " b\"Like most comments I saw this film under the name of The Witching which is the reissue title. Apparently Necromancy which is the original is better but I doubt it.  Most scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad. In many ways I think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value! But don't be fooled -there's only 3 scenes with nudity and it's of the people standing around variety. No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!  This movie is so inherently awful it's difficult to know what to criticise first. The dialogue is awful and straight out of the Troma locker. At least Troma is tongue in cheek though. This is straight-faced boredom personified. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora the possessed kid in The Innocents would you believe!) the worst with her high-pitched screechy voice. Welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque. The other female lead has a creepy face so I don't know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the film! And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also looks worringly like Gene Wilder.  It is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy. This is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also dreadful and it's difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up. The 'ghost' mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs.  Really this film (the witching at least) is only for the unwary. It can't have many sane fans as it's pretty unwatchable and I actually found it mind-numbingly dull!   The best bit was when the credits rolled - enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie LIKE THE PLAGUE!\"\n",
      " b'This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years. It was the first I had ever seen people tortured, so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. It was brutal; the worst thing I had ever seen on film.  Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I\\'ve ever seen on film, and I\\'ve viewed thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again, nor would I recommend it. He makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun, then stay away from this film.  I know there are a lot of sick people out there, many of them professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this sordid, sick story. It\\'s a \"B\" movie, anyway, with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by Charles Bronson. This is not one of his better efforts. Even if it was, there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldn\\'t want to watch. Trust me on this one.'\n",
      " b'First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L\\'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the \"sporty type\" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L\\'Engle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine\\'s character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L\\'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest skipping this movie.'\n",
      " b\"For those who enjoyed the book first, this film seems strangely wrong. The filmmakers are too greatly influenced by a combination of the Merchant-Ivory films, all those wonderful Masterpiece Theatre/BBC historical British dramas and a sort-of light, airy type of film-making that's completely out-of-place for this story.  This family is living on very hard times and I don't think that's shown properly. In the book, Topaz is a much stranger character (in the book, she reminds me of a blonde version of perhaps, Morticia Addams(!) and Mortmain should not just be moody. In the book, he's much more odd...and interesting.  I guess they got Rose and Cassandra right, but there's none of the poverty and hopelessness that's so clearly drawn in the book.  Perhaps this one of those books that simply couldn't be properly adapted nearly 40 years after it was written.\"\n",
      " b\"I always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime-time every year in the 60's. It's a typical Hollywood history epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what, it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn who had the supporting role of Beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again. DeMille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 Commandments to help Quinn pull it off including longtime DeMille associate producer/actor Henry Wilcoxon overseeing the project. Also from the 10 Commandments are screenwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, 2nd unit director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, set directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester who as a costume design team received The Buccaneer's only Oscar nomination. A great cast here from team DeMille headed up by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. At just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.\"\n",
      " b\"I had some expectation for the movie, since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic.   When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way. Well, the very first scene itself pis*ed me off. Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.  The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies.  Well, the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one.And for that, I give a rating of 2 out of 10.  Guys, please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes.  Thats all.\"\n",
      " b\"This film is better than Omega Code and Left Behind but was still unbelievably bad. I can't believe how bad Christian filmaking is today, it's a real shame.

      " b\"It's a little quaint by today's standards, but the writing is witty and the cinematography is excellent. More than that, it's an opportunity to see a 36 year old James Mason acting in a role where he ages 25 years. This was the one Gainsborough film he actually wanted to make, although he had hit the top of the charts with other Gainsborough Gothics such as The Wicked Lady and The Man in Grey. I was rather astonished at his ability to transform his extraordinary brooding good looks into those of a kindly, elderly gentleman with a twinkle in his eye. His gait, voice, and body movements so fitted the role of the elderly man, I believe he could have fooled me without all the makeup.\"\n",

The plot is quite standard for this kind of psychological thriller, but it has its moments, and you can expect some surprises. But it is the solid acting combined with great illumination- and sound techniques that really makes this film worthwhile. Andy Garcia truly shows that he is a great actor, and the supporting actors seem more than believable to me.  All these factors combined results in a solid movie which I highly recommend to anyone.'\n",
      " b'Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film. You know the one.

It\\'s dramatic \\xc2\\x85 it\\'s sappy \\xc2\\x85 it\\'s immensely dull. It does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for ANY sort of newness. Prom Night shares this plight. Watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled. It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.  Our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier. Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife. You\\'d probably go \\xc2\\x85 \"OH! Good lookin guy is going to kill me? Naaaa.\" Not scary even for a second, so the director throws Schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror.

You\\'ll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump (I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING).

I\\'m not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; I\\'m saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump. This is the kind of thing you\\'d expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best. The editor should be shot.  With a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of \"Silver Spoons\", we\\'re left with no reason to support horror this weekend \\xc2\\x85 at least on the big screen. In fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished. Is it really that hard to make a scary movie? Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!!

      " b'However much special pleading may be made for this as an act of deconstructing the documentary process, the fact remains that this is a very badly made film--poorly paced, out of focus, the foreground blitzed by backlight, the comments of Derrida himself reduced to utter vapidity. One comes away with absolutely no understanding of Derrida\\'s philosophy, and no comprehension of his life. The filmmakers followed the guy around for weeks, and the best they could do looks like a high-school video project. There\\'s no excuse for poor craft (something forgotten not just by filmmakers but also by tenured professors besotted with critical theory, who crank out bad prose that says nothing). A far, far better example of how a philosopher can be treated on film is \"McLuhan\\'s Wake,\" which in 90 minutes provides an excellent biographical overview and introduction to the key concepts in the writings of Marshall McLuhan. I\\'m not a fan of McLuhan\\'s any more than I am of Derrida\\'s, but that doesn\\'t stop me from recognizing that McLuhan has received first-class treatment from his documentarians. \"Derrida,\" the film, on the other hand, is an amateurish waste.'\n",
      " b'The interesting aspect of \"The Apprentice\" is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict teamwork skills, task dedication, and job performance. And they certainly don\\'t reveal any hidden agendas. In other words, a good indicator of potential may be to see a job applicant in action which is the point of \"The Apprentice\". People vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugar-coated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview, but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths, weaknesses, and performance.  Briefly, \"The Apprentice\" involves 16 job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity: a position in real estate magnate Donald Trump\\'s investment company. \"The Apprentice\" refers to the winner who will win a salaried position, learn the art of high stakes deal-making from the master himself, and, presumably, gain prime corporate connections. The position is a dream-come-true for those wanting to make more money than the GNP of some foreign countries. To entice the candidates, Trump shows off his private jet, his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork, his limos, his connections to celebrities, and other aspects of the life of a billionaire magnate.  The road to success is not easy. The group is divided into two teams that compete against each other. Each has a corporate-sounding name, such as Versacorps and Prot\\xc3\\xa9g\\xc3\\xa9 Corporation. The teams are assigned tasks that entail an entrepreneurial venture such as creating advertising, selling merchandise, or negotiating. Teams select a project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills to complete the task. If they win, the manager receives a lot of credit, particularly in the eyes of the final arbiter. If they lose, the manager may also become the scape-goat. Some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete. Tasks may involve creating a TV commercial, or print ad. Others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street.  The tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants. They often show immediately who is the most reliable, who is the most trustworthy, and who is hard working. And the tasks also expose who is not a good team player, who is inefficient, and who seems only out for themselves. The tasks invariably reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager. How well the manager communicates with the team, delegates work, organizes time, and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome, but it does not necessarily predict the winner.  The single-most telling aspect of someone\\'s potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager. Their real abilities as opposed to their self-propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a $100 silk tie or a beautiful makeover. Leadership qualities and/or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only a few minutes. Those promoting themselves as top-notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real-life leadership situation. It is always easier to \"toot your own horn\" than to actually engage in leadership. Project managers, even those on the winning teams, often do not formulate a cohesive strategy. They often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient. More often than not, members of an ill-strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring it out as they go along, and in the long run they end up wasting far more time.  The winning team gets a taste of the high life, such as eating dinner at an exclusive restaurant, flying in a private jet, and/or meeting a celebrity. The losing team comes to the dreaded board room where Trump hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous \"You\\'re fired\". Often, the project manager is held partially responsible for the team\\'s loss, and may be the target of Trump\\'s accusatory rhetoric. Every week, at least one person becomes a casualty from the losing team.   My least-favorite aspect of \"The Apprentice\" is the board room. While the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates, the board room often brings out the worst. Unfortunately, the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team, even if the competition was close. Members of the losing team start accusing each other, often ruthlessly, about who was at fault. And sometimes more than one person gets fired. I seldom see an under-performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room. Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her team\\'s losses and received no recognition for this selfless act. For me, Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates. However, Trump saw Kristi as weak and fired her, claiming she wasn\\'t standing up for herself, which may mean he values ego more than integrity. No one should sacrifice their integrity for this. Kristi Frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly. Isn\\'t that worth as much as \"winning\"?  The strength of \"The Apprentice\" is also its weakness. Because team performance is evaluated strictly by winners and losers, other evaluation opportunities are overlooked. Barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams, sometimes a losing team exemplifies a high standard of teamwork and efficiency. I have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team. We Americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence.'\n",
      " b'Securing director Tom Holland for the second season of \"Masters of Horror\" seemed like a horror fan\\'s dream-come-true. This underrated director brought us such horror favorites as \"Fright Night\" and \"child\\'s Play\" and yet I feel he\\'s never been given due credit. The premise here is interesting and clowns are always creepy but \"We All Scream For Ice Cream\" falls flat.  The mood is properly set. Dim, atmospheric lighting and William Forsythe looking insanely creepy as a murderous clown. But the story is garbage, the flick is badly acted with a very boring central character and it\\'s virtually suspenseless. The back story looks like a bad rehash of \"It\" and those kids are really bad actors as well.  A total disappointment, it even lacks solid gore apart from one scene with a guy in a bathtub.

That's it. No vampires at all, but the film does open with a pretty bloody (and totally unnecessary) staking. The film looks great--beautiful sets, nice color and some fairly strong violence (for 1958). But that's about it. The plot is stupid, the pace is slow and it gets pretty dull.  Donald Wolfit, as the doctor, really tries to give a good performance but he's stuck in some lousy makeup that makes him look like Bela Lugosi (WHY?)! Also check out the even worse makeup on his deformed assistant Carl (Victor Maddern). Vincent Ball (horrible actor but handsome) and Barbara Sheeley (beautiful as always but given nothing to do) are the obligatory nice, innocent couple.  Not unwatchable but of very little interest either.\"\n",

And the story of Freddy\\'s kid (Lisa Zane) returning to town to face her evil father is unique.  Overall, the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater. It has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. It\\'s one-sided, it\\'s a magic-trick, and, in the end, it\\'s nothing but goofy, childish entertainment.  '\n",

Watch the thing, and you\\'ll see how it\\'s not something that adds up to the sum of its what-not. It\\'s just Not One of Those kinds of movies.   Instead, it\\'s one of those that has to be seen to be believed, and is worlds-better experienced than recounted. It\\'s a Trip. Through the spaces between people, as well as within India.  And Yes, it has much in common with the rest of director Wes Anderson\\'s stuff, visually and thematically and tonally, in the best ways, if you ask me. I think he was really hittin\\' his stuff on all cylinders in this one.   Just So Much that\\'s implied rather than stated. So Much in the way that people and relationships can be both lamented And celebrated. He just brings So Much to the screen, but always leaves that space that demands the audience step up and meet him on the platform, with our own individual \"baggage\" we\\'ve brought along. It\\'s Great.  And maybe it was the way it was shot and cut and directed and acted, all very subtly, vividly, kinetically...  Maybe it was the way the characters felt really REAL, fascinating and absurd and pathetic and majestic, all at the same time.  Maybe it was because India is so bright and beautiful and exotic, to the tourist\\'s and movie-goer\\'s eyes.  Maybe it was just random enough and specifically-rendered enough to really hit me RIGHT THERE, but IT DID.  I enjoyed this more than any movie I\\'ve seen in a long time.   Real Art made with Real Heart.  So Sad and Funny and Just Damn Beautiful.'\n",
      " b\"Visually disjointed and full of itself, the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an 81 minute snore-fest.   The moments that work in this film are VERY limited, and the characters don't even feel real. How could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal?   Substantively AND stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. Jarring irregular camera work, awkward silences and gaps in action, and what's with the little spider image crawling across the screen? Whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school. It added no meaning, just cheese, and didn't even stylistically work with the rest of the film (assuming the film even had a style, which is a close call). What a flop.\"\n",
      " b\"Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go-round, although I'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last flick, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer Cordell is very fond of. I missed part of this early '90s low-budget quickie, but it was pleasing to see Cordell wracking up the body count in various, gruesome ways. Problem is, the overall film is pretty static, and Cordell simply ain't Jason or Freddy. The interest wanes pretty fast, even with that grand B-movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains scrambled. Stick with the first film in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting, all at the same time.\"\n",
      " b\"An American Cinematheque presentation at The Egyptian.  A great little 'second feature' noir. Hayden is brilliant as the tough and cynical cop willing to break any rule to catch a couple of cop killers, and Phyllis Kirk oozes B-movie sex-appeal as the good-girl caught in the middle. With some genuinely funny dialogue, solid performances all round, and wonderful location filming around downtown Los Angeles, Chinatown and Glendale, the movie is a brilliant testament to the quality of so many cheap post-war crime thrillers. Of particular interest is the location filming inside the LAPD offices and dispatch room in City Hall.  Charles Bronson plays a tough-guy killer in an early supporting role. Timothy Carey shows up to chew the scenery as a bizarre, bog-eyed, dope-fiend, rape-o. And there's a great car chase through the Downtown city streets at night.  A minor classic. Entertaining throughout.\"\n",
      " b'To truly appreciate this film you had to be there (acting?) or have been a crew member.  Yes, I am \"Selena\", and at the ripe old age of 42, have serious doubts about what we were doing/did.  It all started out to be like a \"John Waters\" type thing, friends acting badly in bad films. Somewhere along the line,the fun discontinued, people who were supposed to be friends didn\\'t speak anymore, and BAD became worse.  I regret the bad image I might have projected.(Try to fit in size one gold spandex pants,)  Other than that, the film SUCKS so badly, I would not even make my mama watch it.

      " b\"What can I say about this brilliant TV series? It's simply unforgettable and something to see time and time again. Top-cast actors in a stunning TV-drama, for me it ranks even higher than other classic mini-series such as 'Upstairs-Downstairs' or 'Brideshead Revisited'. The British TV has a great reputation for historical dramas, but I don't think they'll be able to top 'I, Claudius'. 10 out of 10.\"\n",
      " b'\"Five Fingers of Death\" started the American kung-fu movie craze but I remember seeing it for the first time as \"King Boxer\" in Chinatown, NYC, without the bad dubbing and few Americans. I also was fortunate enough to see the American premiere of \"Five Fingers Of Death\" on Times Square, NYC. What a contrast this turned out to be...same film but different audiences.  In Chinatown, this film took on a more serious tone to the viewers. It was because of hearing the real voices of the actors(In Chinese) that made this movie more believable. Chinatown theaters were showing violent kung fu films for years(1972\\'s \"Boxer From Shantung\" beat them all in gore), so the action choreography & story were the main attraction. Rival school plots were not overused yet so the storyline seemed fresh. Every great kung fu film had wonderful, dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and FFoD had them too. The star, Lieh Lo, was a known actor in Chinese theaters. The mostly Chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely. The audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me.  On Times Square, this film was an action comedy...probably unintentionally. I enjoyed it here too but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and quite energetic. From the start, the movie made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard those strange British accents come from those Chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon. Most American audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film. The action sequences blew the audience away. Unfortunately, the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that, bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula.  I had fun seeing this movie with an American audience but enjoyed it much more in Chinatown. Some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of FFoD can\\'t. The original \"King Boxer\" is still enjoyable...a CLASSIC!'\n",
      " b\"This is a great farcical, modern day story. When watching this film I was reminded of the Marx Brothers, some of the early Crosby and Hope films and of course film noir. It also has some of the elements of stage drama a la Moliere. The main character, Johnny Twennies, is indeed the hero and is uniquely performed by Gibson Frazier in a throwback to Bogart,Jimmy Stewart and a dash of Groucho Marx.That is the only way to describe this unusual character.The music in the film is great and is reminiscent of some of Woody Allens films.They are from the jazz age and are legitimized by the appearances Lester Lanin and Bobby Short. Bobby Short is sadly no longer with us having passed away just recently, but performs at the end of this film in its final scene.Mr.Short has a bit role in the film but is worth seeing. I saw this film in 2001 on cable but did not catch the title at the time. Last year a friend remarked that he had seen a weird and quirky film with a character named Johnny Twennies and knew the title. I had to have the film and rented it several times. Yesterday, after hearing of Bobby Short's death, I wandered into a local video/music store and perused the DVDs and there it was, up front and I purchased it. If you need to see something that is truly unique, albeit with 'classic' elements telling and showing the story, Man of the Century is it.\"\n",
      " b'Enjoyed the great acting performance that Mariel Hemingway did with her role as (Christine Connelly),\"Lipstick\",\\'76, in which she plays a very frustrated girl friend who is madly in love with Kurt Russell,(Malcolm Anderson),\"Stargate\",\\'94, who tries to retire as a reporter from a big city newspaper and go to a quite newspaper in Colorado. Malcolm goes to his Managing Editor and tries to resign but becomes involved with a young girl being murdered and from then on all kinds of hell breaks loose. There is lots of action and mystery involved and Richard Jordan,(Alan Delour), \"Posse\",\\'93 adds greatly to the plot and gets deeply involved with Christine and Malcolm. It is sad that Richard Jordan went to a higher stage to perform on and suddenly passed away at an early age. When ever Mariel Hemingway or Kurt Russell perform, you can always expect a great film to view and enjoy.'\n",

      " b\"Faithful to the work of Pearl S. Buck whose years spent in China as a child of Missionary parents that provided her with deep insights into the Chinese culture and its philosophy, this film adaptation is brilliantly done, both in technically artistry and acting.  Wang Lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life: to survive off of his land and to be newly wed to Olan, a servant to a rich and powerful family in the village area. Despite Wang Lung and Olan's best efforts to farm the land, raise kids, and build savings and wealth, a famine threatens to wipe out everything they have worked for. Choosing not to sell their land, a traditional Asian belief, they instead journey to a major city to wait out the famine. While in the city, they are reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families. Although not a looter, Olan gets caught up in a mob looting at a rich man's house. She's summarily rounded up for execution by the army, but is saved at the last minute. Her good fortune, however, is that she found valuable jewels at the looting site that affords her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over again. The newly found wealth transforms Wang Lung. He becomes selfish, self-centered and takes credit for the find. He becomes a very rich farmer but that only makes matters worse as he increasingly becomes more unappreciative, arrogant and difficult to reason with. He loses touch with the basic things in life that money can't buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, fairness and honesty. As punishment, nature once again turns the table on Wang Lung by sending a plague of locust to destroy everything he has. Brought to his knees, Wang Lung enlists the aid of all friends, former friends, workers, and family. With all that help, he succeeds in saving the farm. From that experience, he once again returns to humbleness and an appreciation for the basics in life.\"\n",
      " b\"This show is NOT the marvelous cheese fest of the 1980's movie but a more serious take on the premise. So far it is going well the cast is pretty good except I'm not real keen on Zarkov, he seems too young and is a bit MORE annoying than he should be. But I am please with Flash and Dale they are both have good chemistry and are decent actors.  There are some connections they've added using Flash's Father that are new to the premise. And they do have some good bits of humor sprinkled throughout. We'll keep watching it for now...I'd like it if Ming was a bit more of the Merciless Emperor roll than your typical military dictator in a uniform type but the actor is doing well so we shall see.  I also hope they will be adding in some of the classic characters like Vultan and Prince Baron. Certainly this show is a huge improvement on much of the drek that is currently on TV so I'll keep watching it as long as they don't mess it up or cancel it.\"\n",

This movie was obviously written by an American who doesn\\'t understand our country, and has probably never even been here (at least not for any length of time).  There were so many inaccuracies, not least the total misrepresentation of our political system, and the hopelessly outmoded portrayal of our \"class culture\".

Worse still was the plot, which presented a nauseatingly sentimentalised picture of family life, not to mention a hopelessly unrealistic adolescent relationship.

The primary failure of this movie was that it (A) Assumed you hadn\\'t seen the first movie and (B) Assumed you had. Confused? Go see the movie, then you\\'ll really be confused. The movie retells the entire plot of the \"Lord of the Rings\" in the form of a very long and confusing song which fails to either fully bring you up to speed on the plot or entertain you very much. The characters are then thrown headlong into a poorly animated rendition of the last book of the story, through a blazing and mainly incomprehensible series of events which make no sense unless you\\'ve either read the actual book, or are psychic and can pull plot points out of the aether.

      " b\"I rented this because Max turned it into a high school play in Rushmore. As I watched Serpico, I noted that in the 50 dvds I own, and among dozens of other favorite movies, I don't own a single cop movie. I just never find them even slightly imaginative or engaging. I have no interest in each new benchmark for cop movies, and each new attempt quickly devolves into the same two-hour-plus star vehicle with little room for anything but the male lead; Blow, Traffic, The Departed, Prince of the City, Carlitos Way. These are easily as formulaic as chick flicks. I have no idea why Depp, Cheedle, DiCaprio, Williams & Penn are interested in doing these movies, but maybe we can blame it all on Serpico. At the 40 minute mark I was already irreversibly bored.  Even as a kid I wondered if there was a better person to perform the role of superhero/goodguy Serpico, rather than Al Pacino with his favored expression; the dead-eyed stare. As Serpico he has a gift of alienating both peers and friends. This movie is a catalog of clich\\xc3\\xa9s that made a movie and it's characters seem authentic in the 70s, that now seem pretty hoary. The Boston Strangler is just as dated but a better film. Cop movies easily fall victim to self-righteousness and become sanctimonious in the depiction of good, or equally sanctimonious in indulging the actor playing the villain. Do I care that a cop named Serpico tried to clean up the New York Police force? Sure. Do I care that his story was turned into a very conventional attempt at 'serious' film? Nope. the movie was too lost in various Oscar grabs and sanctimony.\"\n",

She chews up the scenery in every scene she is in, totally stealing the show. This is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the Academy Award, but lost. It was shocking for it\\'s day what with themes of unwed pregnancy, multiple sex partners, and Mildred\\'s vicious language so it is somewhat dated, but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she REALLY thinks of him (\"You cad, you dirty swine....\") is still some of the greatest acting I have ever seen on film.'\n",
      " b'SPOILERS AHEAD! Consider yourself warned!  Seriously, is there any science fiction film of the last thirty years, down to and including the Flash Gordon movie with the nifty Queen soundtrack, not ripped off by this one? Even Independence Day gets ripped off in a scene where hovering spaceships menace a planet.  With a nearly Lucas-caliber disregard for physics (news flash: human bodies at 700 degrees Fahrenheit, whether in the direct rays of the sun or not, would vaporize before you could say \"This planet is named WHAT?\"); a main character who is the walking, beefy definition of a Gary Stu (look it up) to the extent that he can tame giant, spiky rats just by staring them in the CGI-balls; a Lady Macbeth who shares a closet with the Borg Queen; dialogue very possibly stolen from a group of 12-year-olds playing ninja; and an ending that deserves catcalls of disbelief, this movie is saved -- even if, like the annoying Kyra, who you KNOW would get splatted in the first ten minutes of the movie if the Aliens were involved, it subsequently dies again -- only by the few minutes of Dame Judi Dench lowering herself to appear in it. And even then, her character is still saddled with a name (\"Aereon\") that would go much better on a car.  Thandie Newton\\'s performance deserves special mention, because it helps you understand why the movie version of Beloved was such a flop. Her Dame Vaako is going straight to Star Trek supporting-cast hell, right along with Lwaxanna Troi. Karl Urban, who looked like a Harley dude in the LotR trilogy, fits in a bit better here, because people aren\\'t expected to make sense.  One defender of this \"movie\" asks its critics what they themselves have ever created, particularly in film. I reply: You don\\'t have to be a cordon-bleu chef to figure out when there\\'s a rat in your hamburger. Especially a giant, spiky one that cuddles with Vin Diesel.'\n",
      " b\"Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer \\xc2\\x96 when it's in the right hands that is \\xc2\\x96 A Bug's Life is a warm reminder. We walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions.  It is only Pixar's second animated feature. The sub-group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie Toy Story. It was a movie which defied convention, re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.  After all, it's a film about ants. Well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug's Life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? Surely they jest. However, we forget that in Toy Story, a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter.  Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable \\xc2\\x96 there isn't an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters \\xc2\\x96 but they're colourful, they're eclectic, and they're idiosyncratic. And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug's Life from the beginning. We shall start with our main character, and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful Ant Island, he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics.  The problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term. Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands; however, it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. The cogs and clockwork in Flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers.  If you think about it, A Bug's Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai, or the American remake The Magnificent Seven, in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies \\xc2\\x96 one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. In A Bug's Life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl.  Much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. Among them are an erudite stick insect (David Hyde Pierce), a side-splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (Dennis Hopper). It's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen, as is the entire movie collectively.  As I've said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. What makes A Bug's Life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film \\xc2\\x96 the clich\\xc3\\xa9d kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like. However, it's easy to ignore this fault, and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film.  Although A Bug's Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here. Pixar have proved that they're not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood. They raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it's only always by themselves. What more is there to say about A Bug's Life other than: see it; it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at Emeryville, California, but this beats out the lot of its year \\xc2\\x96 and I'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998.  8.5/10\"\n",
      " b'I don\\'t want to born opens in a hospital delivery room where mum to be Lucy Carlesi (Joan Collins) is giving birth. Dr Finch (horror film veteran Donald Pleasence) is on hand to assist. He looks at at the nurse and claims, \"this baby doesn\\'t want to be born\". So he gives the little lad a helping hand, using some large medical tongs he grabs hold of the baby and pulls him out, nice. Waiting in some room elsewhere in the hospital the dad Gino Carlesi (Ralph Bates) hears the good news from Dr Finch. Finch informs Gino both mother and baby are fine. However things take a turn for the worse almost immediately, they hear screams, they rush to Lucy who\\'s cheek has been scratched by the little lad. Dr Finch puts it down to basic survival instincts and that Lucy was holding him too tightly. Once the family are back home things don\\'t improve. The baby wrecks his room, breaking and throwing things all over the place, and he starts to have a violent fit of some sort when Lucy and Gino try to christen him in a church. Lucy knows something is wrong, talking to her friend Mandy (Caroline Munro) she confesses that she thinks he may be possessed by the devil! Mandy, as any good friend probably would, tries to comfort her. But Lucy starts to tell a story, the film now goes into flashback as we see Lucy dancing on stage at a sleazy strip club. Back stage fellow performer Hercules (George Claydon), a dwarf(!) hits on her. She makes it perfectly clear shes not interested, the clubs owner Tommy Morris (John Steiner) bursts in and throws Hercules out and has sex with Lucy. Hercules seems to hold a grudge because as Lucy is walking out of the club he jumps out and puts a curse on any future child Lucy might have, he says \"your child will be as big as I am small, and will be possessed by the devil!\" And thats about it really, thats all he does, and it works too. Either that or this kid has some serious problems! Add Ginos sister, a nun from Italy sister Albana (Eileen Atkins), extremely worried babysitters, Dr Finch constantly trying to explain the baby\\'s problems through medical reasoning, bizarre deaths, an exorcism and we have the mid 70\\'s horror I don\\'t want to be born! Directed by Peter Sasdy this is a real product of the 70\\'s, everything screams the 70\\'s, clothes, hairstyles, cars, the interior of houses and offices, music, the way London looks, absolutely everything. Thats not really a criticism, just an observation. The acting is OK, I especially liked John Steiner as the sleazy wise cracking strip club owner. There\\'s a bit of nudity and some sex but no real violence or gore in it, but the killings are good enough. I think the film fails slightly because the idea just isn\\'t developed at all, the whole film is basically the baby being violent and killing the odd person, other characters like Lucys friend Mandy and Dr Finch are introduced, but nothing is done with them over the bare minimum. One more thing I found odd is that the baby is never given a name, at least no one calls it by any name at any point. The film gets a bit dull after a while, and it drags in a couple of places too. OK I guess, nothing special, worth a watch if you can catch it on TV for free (like me), but its not really worth paying good money for.'\n",
      " b'Of course the average \"Sci-Fi\" Battle Star Gallactica fan will hate this. That kind of makes me happy. I don\\'t like those cheesy sci-fi shows especially Battle-star Gallactica and that is why I like this show.  The creators of the show got a lot of heat for making this (the unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it. I read on Wiki that they wanted to appeal to everybody including women and not just sci-fi nerds.  This is probably the most promising show since Lost. It has the most interesting, clever, and deepest script of any show in some time and it is truly unique.  What I love most about the show is that it kind of plays out like a great Anime! From young teens running around shooting guns, to and extremely well balanced and complex script, to robots it reminds me of something that came from Japan except a little bit better (most Anime is too confusing).'\n",
      " b\"There are two kinds of characters on THE SHIELD: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing, and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes, and everyone's only hope. More than any other show, THE SHIELD is about hypocrisy and self-delusion. Unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-deluders are the shows heroes, and as such have the typical genre-fiction heroes' improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again, making fools out of all of their peers.  The show boasts excellent camera-work. The lead ins and the fade outs are always superb. It really is a work of art to see. Unfortunately the story is a cartoony, overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence, rape, and lies.  The hero, who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme, is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character, always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds (anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show, always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice, and ALWAYS scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications. If another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing, and someone gets hurt because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious cop, regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause. Every time.  Like 24, this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season. Boring, unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody, perverted chunks of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover-ups.  Most disappointing though, is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth, to and away form the characters on whims. Sometimes, they want us to see Shane as the enemy. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul. Sometimes they want us to see Vic as a dangerous, sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold. Sometimes they want us to see Mara as a low down vile Jezebel. Then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with Shane, that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic.  None of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want. Once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends, that's it. It is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth. But then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right under everyone's noses.\"\n",
      " b\"This was a really cool movie. It just goes to prove that you don't need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. It traverses continents in seconds, people get shot and nothing happens to them, swords set on fire, samuari fight on sinking galleons, David Essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and John Rhys Davies is just the dude. I enjoyed this movie but I like s**t movies, this is the perfect example of a very s**t movie that just KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth you'll love this film, its swashbuckling, its fast, its silly, its samuaraitastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It also looks as if it was made in 1972\"\n",
      " b'These reviews were given by Moviegoers after recent film festival screenings...they were posted on various web-sites...I hope they don\\'t mind me posting them here.  1) I thought this movie was a great depiction of many small town people and their lives when they turn teenagers. Many are so used to being around that small net of people, that they find it difficult to pack up, leave, and follow their own dreams. The Garage does a great job at portraying the life of a kid that is stuck between leaving or staying, and the choice might seem easy to some of us, but we are able to see that it is very difficult. I truly enjoyed this film and could not take my eyes of the screen....  2) This is a great movie about the relationship between a father and his adult son. It focuses on the dilemma of the son, Matt, who plans to break away from his home life and find his place in the world. Many things keep happening that keep him from leaving home. He becomes motivated to leave when his friend, who was supposed to go with him, dies. This enables the young man to decide to leave home. Through out the movie, the central theme was the father-son relationship. Not only was the main character struggling to tell his father that he wants to leave home, but, the father of his best friend is violent toward him. The end of the movie wraps this theme up in a way that I thought was unique. It ends by showing the viewer Matt\\'s relationship with his son in the future. Although it is a bit lengthy, the movie is a delightful, yet sad, story about breaking away from the family and finding one\\'s own path.  3) The Garage. The fact that the story is a coming of age story set in 1970\\'s small town Texas should not deter you from seeing this film. The cinematography is wonderful, the acting is great, and if you think seeing another film of this genre is close to torture, then you really should see what Carl Thibault has created, breathing fresh, new life into the genre. This film took the SoCal award for Best Screenplay \\xc2\\x96 catch this film at a festival near you to see why\\xc2\\x85  4) This film succeeds on so many levels, it is difficult to review. Perhaps it is best to start with what it does not do. While telling an \"every town\" coming-of-age story, the film never succumbs to clich\\xc3\\xa9. Somehow it invokes the \"automobile as vehicle of redemption\" in such a visceral, physical way that you can smell the grease and feel it on your skin. The same film on video would have been a disappointment. The grain of the film itself adds texture. I immediately thought of a dozen people from three generations who I feel need to see this movie--for the simple but heartrending truths it tells, for the reminiscences it stirs, for the music (original and fantastic), and for the acting (surprising given the youth of the actors). Bravo--an American classic.  5) Saw this feature film at a festival in CA earlier this year. I really enjoyed it. Growing up in a small town, I could definitely relate to the main character and what was pushing/pulling him. For me, there was something nostalgic about the viewing experience. In my mind, this film is deserving of its many accolades. Bravo indeed.  6) Writer/Director Carl Thibault has made a really good film. I just watched this movie at the San Joaquin Film Festival and it blew me away. The basic story is not new. Set in a small town in Texas in the late 70s, the main character, Matt, must make the most important choice of his life. He can stay buried in the going-nowhere job of mechanic in his father\\'s run-down auto repair garage or he can escape to the outside world and rise above the dead end life he\\'s destined for. This film is beautifully photographed, acted, directed, written, edited, and scored. It never has that feel of low budget. Thibault\\'s excellent film is independent cinema at its best. I actually give this picture 4 and a half stars. (out of 5 stars)'\n",
      " b'I was rummaging in my old things a while back and pulled out a bunch of old movies. This was one of them. This movie is VERY enjoyable for anyone to watch as a child. I remember my brother and I laughing at it as children, but seeing it as a teenager or an adult probably wouldn\\'t be a good idea. The story is alright, but the animation is not very good. If anything shined in this movie it was the females dwarfs (i forgot what they are called ^_^). Their characters were all lovable and even a bit memorable. Snow White and the Prince, as always, were lifeless and cardboard. Another thing that sticks out in this movie was one song titled \"Thunderella\\'s Song\". The melody is pretty and it\\'s definitely a cute and catchy tune. So cute and catchy that I remembered it through the years as I would Aladdin or the Lion King. This movie is alright for one watch. I\\'d give it a 4/ 10.'\n",
      " b'A terrific lesser-known film that deserves a better rating than the one given it here at IMDb.  Based on a short story by Joyce Carol Oates called \"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\", \"Smooth Talk\" stars Laura Dern as a bored and restless adolescent who thinks she\\'s more in control of her sexual allure, and more capable of handling the attention she receives for it, than she is. In a deeply unsettling and slightly surreal scene, a hunky stranger (Treat Williams) comes calling for her, and she realizes that she\\'s not as mature as she thinks. The film captures the same other-worldly quality of the short story (the scene with Treat Williams plays out almost like a feverish dream), while ably adapting it to the very different needs of a feature length film.  Dern gives a wonderful performance, one of the many given by this underrated actress. And another lovely performance comes from Mary Kay Place, who plays Dern\\'s mother. One of the most memorable scenes for me came when mother and daughter are in separate rooms of the house, but unbeknownst to each other are both privately dancing to the same song playing on the radio. I can never hear James Taylor\\'s \"Handyman\" without thinking of this movie.  Grade: A'\n",
      " b'\"Silverlake Life\" is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward. Actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illuminations, see something else. And it\\'s by no means a tearjerker. But I mean that in positive ways. It shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with AIDS is affecting the quality of their every-day lives. It\\'s almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not, because it was so undressed that I had to look for other ways to respond. It\\'s an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents I\\'ve ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes Hollow-wood productions on AIDS seem hip and heartless. These men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings \"You are My Sunshine\" to Mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing.'\n",
      " b'no, this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance, but it is brilliant in its own right. you have to look at it for what it is, a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride. those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden \"gem\" as they say and just didn\\'t quite get there. i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the \"5 cent baby attached to a fish pole\" hahaha, well, yes. i don\\'t think a movie with a budget like this could afford \"good\" actors or effects so they worked with what they had. the guts and entrails were actually very convincing. the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall, this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn\\'t follow any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.'\n",
      " b\"Alas, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Credible performances, but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there. First we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story. Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, on and on. Finally, long after you don't care anymore, you will learn something about the script meetings. Three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision. The end result? All three were used, one, after another, after another. If you can hang in past the 100th yawn, you'll be able to pick them out. Despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, this one should have washed out the very first day.\"\n",
      " b\"You shouldn't come into this DVD expecting any kind of real documentary whatsoever. If you're watching for the T&A, OK, it's got that in spades so you can probably not bother reading the rest. Personally my girlfriend and I were hoping for an actual focus on the the burlesque show itself, being fans of the genre, even if the SGs loosely interpret it. There is very little of their performance shown and it's only in brief teaser clips mostly. Almost all the behind the scenes stuff was either interviews that just felt like advertisements for the Suicide Girls website or was just more nudity for the sake of the camera.  So basically it's a softcore nudie flick and an advertisement masquerading as something else. This is not surprising given the self-promoting character of the man behind the girls. Just know that if you want naked girls, this is probably fine for you, but if you're looking for some actual documentation, skip it.\"\n",
      " b\"Ever since 1981, Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that there's a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons.   And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010.\"\n",

      " b'Yes, as unbelievable as it may be, in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for best picture - and it was the third musical to win that award in a five-year period, the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! however is that Oliver! is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust Oliver!. The acting is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dancing is great. This movie is dynamic, topical, relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs of New York, Oliver! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century London, England that evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.'\n",
      " b\"Giallo fans, seek out this rare film. It is well written, and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films. I don't want to give anything away, so I wont even say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get this film in english is from European Trash Cinema, for $15.\"\n",
      " b\"Story - pretty good.  Cinematographry - amazing!   If you want to enjoy the camera-work, please see this on the Criterion DVD. That's not a plug for the company. It's just that no one else has ever offered a cleaner version of this film. After suffering for years with lousy VHS transfers of this gem, it was nice to see it given justice.  To me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super. To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag. I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason. Despite his billing, Orson Welles has a small role in here. He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed. Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten dominates the story, along with Alida Valli, sort of a poor man's Ingrid Bergman. Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears.   In addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir. It's lighthearted music from a zither, almost circus-like in its sound and melody....but I liked it. It helps make this movie different.  The visuals involve a lot of nighttime photography, lots of shadows and cobblestone streets. The tilted camera angles and the closeups - all traits of Wells the director, are here to enjoy\"\n",
      " b\"Don't bother renting this movie.  National Geographic and Paramount start out filming the cutest little polar bear since Knut.  They add silly narrative.  Then things take a turn for the worse.  They stick in some guff about global warming.  Why didn't bloody National Geographic fly in some steaks for the polar bears? Don't they sell enough of their magazines? Doesn't bloody Paramount have some spare change to helicopter in some goodies for the cute little bears? Why did they let'em die?\"\n",
      " b\"Sweet Helen Hunt is better for bland Andrew McCarthy than sexy-but-bitchy and thoughtless Kelly Preston, but it takes him the entire movie to figure that out. This painfully predictable comedy tries to delay the inevitable by coming up with a series of forced scenes and situations, and it's also visually dreary, despite the potentially majestic locations. I think Hunt is the best thing in the picture. (*1/2)\"\n",

      "[b\"I was in college in Laramie, Wyoming, at the time of the Matthew Shepard tragedy, and will always be ashamed that such a crime could have taken place in my community. With that said, this movie gets it all wrong. They went for easy plot devices, the furthering of stereotypes (which shouldn't be Matthew's legacy), and a misrepresentation of the community. The sad part is that with a little work, they could have made a film that sent a lasting message. Instead they made a movie that portrayed a town full of simple minded rednecks who somehow have Southern accents, a police force consisting of a Barney Fife cop, and a total reinvention of certain parts of the story. Being that the idiots that murdered Matthew came from Laramie, examining the responsibility of the community is fair, but this isn't examination. This is lazy story telling that MTV unfortunately passed off as an educational film (They used to show it late at night without commercials as part of their Cable in the Classroom series so educators could tape it). If you want to see the definitive movie (or play) on the Matthew Shepard tragedy, see The Laramie Project. That movie doesn't let anyone off the hook. It doesn't look for easy answers, and it gives the subject matter the true examination it deserves.\"\n",
      " b'Not many reviews, hence thought i would add one.  DO NOT GO BY THE OTHER REVIEWS! This was a excellent movie.  RKS is one of the very few Indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie.  AB and Akshay given yet another example of great acting, as does bhoomika too, which was a little unexpected, but great to watch.  Am surprised there has not been much hype around release.  Or filmfare/other awards nominations, considering how good the movie was.  Better then Khakee i thought and i thought Khakkee too was good movie.  Is a fairly long movie, but definitely worth it and while watching it, definitely does seem long.  Cant wait for RKS next movie and the next AB, Akshay movie they always seem to do well together... e.g. waqt.  Bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future.'\n",
      " b'no, this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance, but it is brilliant in its own right. you have to look at it for what it is, a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride. those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden \"gem\" as they say and just didn\\'t quite get there. i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the \"5 cent baby attached to a fish pole\" hahaha, well, yes. i don\\'t think a movie with a budget like this could afford \"good\" actors or effects so they worked with what they had. the guts and entrails were actually very convincing. the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall, this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn\\'t follow any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.'\n",
      " b'I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only mildly amused! I must say however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O\\'Connor wasn\\'t given a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent.  There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been funnier.  I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. Brent Spiner proves that \"Data\" from Star Trek the Next Geeration is not the only good character he can play.  The storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and I laughed heartily throughout this movie and I highly recommend it.'\n",
      " b'I enjoyed the first \"Pet Sematary\" and rented this because I wanted some cheesy entertainment. It won\\'t disappoint if one is looking for cheese, but on most every other front it will. The main problem is that Edward Furlong, our protagonist, has virtually nothing to do. Clearly he was cast because of his participation in \"Terminator 2.\" While I find Furlong to be somewhat grating (the pubescent cracking of the voice and the eyes glowering under too-long bangs), he did create a coherent character in \"T2.\" Yet here he is given very little dialogue and exists to merely sleepwalk through scenes. I kept waiting for him to respond to his tormentors with some biting comment, or have some insight into death, but he is a cipher. If he had been a proactive character--at least as interesting as the bully and the abusive sheriff--this movie would have been an above average horror.'\n",
      " b\"Emily Watson's Natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I have ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. Or, is she transmuted to the king? The internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control, power, and victory is stunning. Just as the chess masters in the film do, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once, but all weave into either major or minor patterns. The period, the costumes, and imagery of early 20th century Italy's lake district is captured magnificently. Not a single square of space is wasted.  So many brilliant scenes abound, I cannot recount them all. I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly a week apart, because you can't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64-square yet multi-dimensional framework in one setting.   I did not read Nabakov's book, but to try an analogy of my own, what I am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie, Barry Levinson's The Natural. It totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing Russian and Italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment. The true story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both contestants draw. But, in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit.   Pure love, as personified by Emily Watson's Natalia, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously. Only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it.  This is a magnificent movie (10/10).\"\n",
      " b\"Absurd adaptation of a dinner-theater perennial by Alec Coppel has television-writer Glenn Ford attempting to cover up a murder by burying the corpse underneath wife Debbie Reynolds' garden gazebo. This type of sitcom nonsense--featuring totally unreal supporting characters bursting into the scenario at just the wrong moment (such as the pushy real-estate agent)--doesn't usually work on film; the would-be eccentricities stick out as phony artifices. Comedy shows from television have since put a stamp on this kind of bungling silliness...but were over-the-top, frazzled-nerves-slapstick ever really fresh? Ford and Reynolds are actually a good screen match, but not when paired with this leaden script. Awkward, talky, and mercilessly unfunny. * from ****\"\n",
      " b'What an entertaining movie. Astaire and Randolph Scott are in the Navy. Astaire has to woo back Ginger in San Francisco, while Scott must be persuaded that Harriet Hilliard is worthy of being his wife. Everything works out fine.  It\\'s sometimes argued, and I can see why, that Scott\\'s romance with Hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down. Especially painful are Hilliard\\'s singing of sappy love songs. I could have done without her singing, right enough, but I found the romance rather touching. Hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher, wearing a pair of spectacles, no makeup, and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast. No wonder Scott avoids her until she grooms herself sexily under the tutelage of her sister Ginger and a slinky Lucille Ball. The problem is that AFTER her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before, only with a glossier outfit. It\\'s tough enough for a homely guy. But at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular, then he can collect women anyway, even if he looks like JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy. But what does a plain-looking woman do? The same avenues to romance aren\\'t open to her. Henry Kissinger had groupies. Did Margaret Thatcher? It must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours. As a kind of a footnote, I must mention that Randolph Scott was rumored to be bisexual by Hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on, and it\\'s kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when he\\'s putting homely Hilliard off -- \"Women don\\'t interest me, sister.\" The movie probably gives more quality time to Ginger Rogers than any of her other films with Astaire. And she\\'s marvelous. She\\'s beautiful, sexy, a talented actress and dancer, and the script gives her good comic lines too. \"Let\\'s kiss and make up,\" suggests Astaire. \"Let\\'s just make up,\" she says, \"that will give you something to work on.\" It\\'s also the only film she made with Astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition. (Choreographed by Hermes Pan.) Her performance is accidentally sabotaged by Astaire who slips some Alka Seltzer or something into her water, and she hiccups through her number, burping being too indelicate for the time.  As a dancer, I\\'d make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur, but I think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film. Their first, during a dancing contest, \"Let Yourself Go,\" is the most wildly exuberant of any I can remember. And the only dramatic duet, \"Let\\'s Face the Music and Dance,\" must be among their finest. The last step as they exit is startling.  I like the film for reasons with personal resonance. I remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown San Diego, next to a shop called \"The Seven Seas\" that catered to sailors. I was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of Astaire and Scott. What I mean is, here we have this frothy musical comedy which owed absolutely nothing to historical reality, and yet, unlike most of their other teamings, pays its dues anyway. Jumping ship, Astaire calls out for a \"water taxi.\" I had just taken a water taxi ashore myself. The uniforms are correct to the period (unlike, say, those in \"On the Town\"). And they\\'re worn properly, hats down to two finger-widths above the eyebrow and not cocked back. And there are two incidents in which Astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and they\\'re both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable. An officer stops Astaire from leading a jazz band during inspection and reports to the captain, \"They were playing when the call was sounded, sir. I\\'m certain no breach of discipline was intended.\" It\\'s what an officer -- a good officer -- would say, and nobody laughs.  The series was getting a little repetitious by the time \"Follow the Fleet\" was made so instead of putting Fred into high society and a tuxedo, they turned him into a gum-chewing swabbie instead. It was a good idea. And the dance numbers are up to the concept.'\n",
      " b'The pain I endured during the viewing of this film was unbelievable. I didn\\'t exactly have high hopes for this film, in fact I watched it merely because I was in need of a laugh. But unfortunately for me, my brain could not have sustained worse damage had I repeatedly ran head first into a brick wall.   SPOILERS AHEAD 70% OF THE FILM RUINED(not that there\\'s a plot anyway)  A man named Billy hasn\\'t been paying his rent. Enter the rockard African Americans with bad Australian dubbed voices who proceed to get there arses kicked by the mighty Billy. They go back to there boss and.... that\\'s where my IQ dropped 24 points. Anyway Billys mother is eventually killed and his sister kidnapped, so he sets out on a journey to \"revenge\" his mothers death (no I\\'m not joking he really does say that)  Most of the film concentrates on Billy randomly going to sites with bad guys and pointing a gun in different directions to shoot his load. These sessions are followed by large intervals of talking. The talking seems to go on for hours which is probably thanks to the gut wrenching dubbing, the silly looking characters and the annoying music.   The other untimely classic character this film introduces is Gordon  Gordon the ninja is challenged by the mighty Ivan the red. Ivan wants to kill Gordon so he may be crowned as the ultimate ninja. If Gordon refuses Ivan will go on a ninja killing spree until Gordon changes his mind. Obviously Gordon being the intelligent man that he is refuses and Ivan proceeds to wipe every last ninja from the face of the earth. One thing Ivan should have considered is how can the ninjas praise him as the grandmaster if there all dead? But oh well none of the other characters use there brain in this film why should he be any different?  The main thing I noted about the characters in this film was that every one of them especially the ninjas were so superbly trained. No matter how many times a character was shot, slashed or stabbed they just wouldn\\'t bleed, no blood was spilt in this film whatsoever.   Another thing I noted was that every ninja in this movie was a white American. Every time one of the ninjas died they would pull the stupidest face ever before keeling over at a ludicrous speed which had me in fits of laughter. It actually kept me watching to see if the next ninjas death was funnier than the last. But the repetitive Billy scenes just kept coming back over and over and over, and I\\'ve just had enough of typing now. I would say more about this disgrace to planet earth, but even thinking about this film for too long could cause irreparable brain damage.'\n",
      " b'After two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine. Her driver stops at an odd location on Mulholland Drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her way down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman\\'s apartment. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the vacationing woman\\'s niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. The bulk of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.  The above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but that\\'s not the half of it. The film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. It\\'s basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around. Even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded films--such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004)--you may not understand it on a second viewing, either. The studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director David Lynch write \"10 clues to unlocking this thriller\" and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the DVD. Lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. It doesn\\'t help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be \"real\" and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual clues that they\\'re flashbacks.  But is the film worth watching, or worth trying to figure out? That depends on your tastes, obviously. On a surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers. But those qualities, and many other surrealist aspects of the film, are typical of Lynch. A prime Lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they\\'re alien pod people trying to put on a front. If you\\'re familiar with that style and like it, you\\'ll find much to love here, although in many ways, Mulholland Drive is fairly understated for Lynch. It\\'s also worth noting, for viewers who\\'ll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene. It\\'s not gratuitous, although I have no problems with gratuitousness, but is instead an important hinge in the film.  Like all of Lynch\\'s films, it\\'s easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail. Any serious student of film (including \"armchair students\"/\"cinephiles\") should study Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch doesn\\'t let anything pass unmanipulated. He includes brilliant color schemes (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. He makes unusual use of sound, such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd pauses. He lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through, such as the name \"Winkie\\'s\", and the \"Hot Dogs--made for Pinks\" sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism.  Lynch\\'s attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning. It\\'s interesting to note that Lynch even apparently demands that the DVD programming be unusual--there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points.  If the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you, or if you\\'re just fond of \"puzzles\", then Mulholland Drive is well worth watching for that aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. I won\\'t recount the standard interpretation here--it is worth researching, but only after you\\'ve seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it.  For my money, however, although I generally love Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, it is not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (I have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings). To me, though, the \"twist\" aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches, but the plot doesn\\'t carry them as well as some of Lynch\\'s other films.  Still, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd. If you\\'re serious about film and do not mind having to think about what you watch (as if those two would not necessarily coincide), you shouldn\\'t miss this one.'\n",
      " b\"The whole thing seemed to be constantly on one median level, with very few shocks. It never really yanks you into the story, and the music is extremely loud and dirge-like, making you feel like you're watching a very tepid documentary made without much thought. An extremely peculiar, rather uninteresting film, a considerable step down from the first film (which wasn't terrific, but was at least exciting!)  I think they should have got Tobe Hooper in again - perhaps he was busy. It's very similar in feel to Halloween 4, which was a complete waste of time - there's a feeling that nobody knew what they were doing during the whole creation process, particularly the music composers, who were obviously filling time until they were discovered by Philip Glass.\"\n",
      " b\"This movie is up there with the all-time classics. The music, camera shots, and acting are excellent. Showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly, like Psycho. Its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie.

Why does this tale (awash in sentimentality in Francis Hodgson's book of the same name) - yet LIVE ON? Anime and even a Russian version are recent. It's still a great tale!  The 1936 LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY movie is basically like the 1930's movie HEIDI in one key way...i.e. the GRANDFATHER connection:   A prodigal people-hating even life-hating old grandfather is brought back to the human race and to his God - by the love of a kind and good grandchild.  In this great (but technically damaged) David O. SELZNICK quality family film, ....The old prodigal GRANDFATHER (the great Sir C. Aubrey Smith as the Earl) is brought back to the human race by his kind and good grandchild Cedric Errol (Freddie Bartholomew, the top male 1930's child star).   ************** Wade thru the second-rate copy of this movie ...and hope that - the studio does a quality restoration of this great film.  NOTE: the current worldwide interest in LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY should make it worth the studio's while to issue a QUALITY restored edition of 1936 LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY. Just make sure to dub it in Russian, Japanese and many other languages!\"\n",
      " b'There has been a barrage of action films over the last two decades. Stallone\\'s and Segal\\'s stuff come to mind. All of these movies had plenty of action, violence and profanity. But the two things these movies were lacking were sustainable plot and character development.  In 1988, Die Hard came out. Bruce Willis, who before hand had only Blind Date and Moonlighting to his credit, was cast as the main character, John McClane. Richard Gere, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Burt Reynolds were all up for the role. The thing that separates McClane from all other action heroes before this movie is that McClane is an average character. He isn\\'t a robot; he isn\\'t some big muscley guy, or an expert and karate. He\\'s vulnerable, bitter about his failing marriage, he\\'s a funny guy. Schwarzenegger or Stallone would have never been able to achieve this. Gere and Reynolds have had too much confidence. Neither is particularly good at being sarcastic either. And the main thing that separates Bruce Willis from all the others is that Willis ad-libbed most of his funny one-liners. No one else could have brought the same charisma to John.  The opening scene has John McClane gripping his seat as his plane is landing. This opening scene shows you how McClane can be vulnerable and that he does have fears. The passenger next to him notices John\\'s fear of flying and gives him this advice: \"After you get where you\\'re going, take off your shoes and socks and make fists with your toes.\" Once at the Christmas party, he learns that his wife, Holly, still uses her maiden name, and meets Ellis, the womanizing, cocaine snorting, co-worker of Holly. Ellis evidently has his eye on Holly. He\\'s also pretty arrogant as he points out the Rolex that he and the company gave to Holly for all her hard work. John and Holly get away to a private washroom to talk by themselves, a talk that escalates into an argument over their marriage. In the middle of their argument, Holly is brought out to give a speech to the rest of the workers. John is left there to think about his stupidity of picking an argument with his wife the minute he arrives. Still tense from the flight, he takes off his shoes and socks and makes fists with his toes.  Meanwhile, a man named Hans Gruber and his group of \"terrorists\" pulls into the in-door parking lot of Nakatomi Plaza. After cutting off the phone lines and exits, they seize control of the Christmas party by gathering them all into one room. John McClane, armed with only his police issue Berretta, manages to escape out the emergency exit while the terrorists are gathering up the others. Shoeless and sickle\\'s, he manages to make it to an empty floor where he\\'s panicked, alone, and scared.  Hans Gruber is methodical, precise, and is patient. He\\'s charming and intelligent and he doesn\\'t seem like the type of person to kill another human in cold blood. He takes the head of the company, Takagi, up to the next floor where they work him for the access code to the main computer. When Takagi makes it apparent that he doesn\\'t know the code, Hans doesn\\'t hesitate. He shoots him through the head, point blank. Meanwhile, a shocked John is hiding behind a table, where he witnesses the killing of Takagi.  This is a summary of the first 30 minutes of the film, and I\\'m not going to give anything else away. Already, we\\'ve got a sense of what our two main characters are like. Unlike most action movies, the bad guy isn\\'t a maniacal psycho who enjoys violence and kills people without an ounce of mercy. He\\'s still an evil man who will kill anyone if it serves his purpose. But we understand Han\\'s motivations. John McClane is a much chattier protagonist than most action heroes, and even talks to himself on numerous occasions before he starts talking Hans or the cops. It\\'s easier to identify with him.  Even if you are not a fan of action movies, Die Hard is a movie that everyone should see at least once. It will definitely help you appreciate action movies much more, even if it doesn\\'t convert you into a total fan of the genre.'\n",
      " b\"The first von Trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa.

Because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. The society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. By coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. The atmosphere is astounding.

      " b\"I was kinda forced into watching this film having started reading through 'American Silent Film' by William Everson (a very good book, I hasten to add on, er, well the title says it all) and encountering an entire chapter on, first, 'Birth of a Nation' (which I duly watched) and, then, 'Intolerance'.  I was already a fan of the Silent Screen so I approached it with a great amount of expectation, especially as Mae Marsh and Lillian Gish were in it whose performances in 'Birth' I thought were two of the finest I'd seen in silent movies.  However, in my opinion, the film is as poor as 'Birth' is brilliant.  Sure, there are a great amount of high spots when you look at film technique (such as the moving camera in part two that zooms in over the heads of the crowds - and the grand sets of Babylon are stunning to say the least) but the film is a mishmash of ideas that are forced into employment as examples of 'Intolerance' when you could view alternate characters as equally displaying the trait.  The film started life as the 'Modern Story only' prior to 1916 which was then used as the basis to have the other two main and one rather sketchy story cut into it (the Jesus narrative is, to be honest, not a story but a series of excerpts from the life which support the other three stories at certain points). To me, it shows - it's just *too* chaotic a film to be enjoyable (even by 1916 standards).  A couple of other points - Mae Marsh's performance is semi-decent although there appears to be a bit too much over-dramatisation at points while Constance Talmadge's character (the Babylonian Mountain Girl) although sometimes implausible is a nice humorous insertion (I used to know a girl like that!).  Why Griffith gave Lillian Gish the sole acting role of rocking a cradle throughout the film with no other input, I can't imagine (there must've been some good reason for it) as her acting ability was, for me, the highlight of 'Birth'.  If you're a movie-buff, this film is a must-see. Don't miss it! But, like me, you may wonder 'Why?'.  One lighter point - did anyone notice that where the train stops is the same place that Keaton used in 'The Goat' for the shot of him riding the train?\"\n",

      " b'The Beat that my Heart Skipped is a beautiful film.  Thomas Seyr is a property dealer. A broker. A fast talker. A fixer. He and his two partners encourage sellers to sell cheap. Encouragement includes releasing rats into the property at night or the liberal use of baseball bats.  But this is a beautiful film.  Mr Shady Adrenalin-Rush Seyr has a past. Not a bad past - more of a silver lining that accidentally gets uncovered. Like his mother, he used to play piano. A twist of circumstances has him suddenly realising he has a chance to be a pianist and he takes lessons to prepare for an audition. An audio flashback has his teacher telling him, \"The emotion is not very generous\" and at the same time the film slips into a minor key as our emotional involvement with the character kicks in.  Playing piano interferes with Thomas\\' being a total bastard, much to the annoyance of his colleagues who don\\'t want him pussyfooting around with such a silly hobby, but the audience and Thomas sense a soul struggling to shine through his shitty persona and the amphetamine paced timeframe stops the movie from going gooilly sentimental. More formula as we see him at the piano naked from the waist up after making love, flattering lighting, Chopin, Debussy, Bach and Mozart. Sensuousness and arty mix. Electro moves to classical. The Beat that My Heart Skipped carefully pushes all the right buttons, but still seems fresh given French naturalistic acting, an unpredictable storyline, great soundtrack, and being entertaining and funny. A remake of an American movie with Harvey Keitel, it stands up quite well even if lacking in substance.  Thomas perhaps eventually finds what his heart missed, though not quite as predicted.'\n",
      " b\"Ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence. You can count about 10 clich\\xc3\\xa9s that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot. Kurt Russell's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding. Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!\"\n",
      " b'This movie is a quotation after quotation of James Cameron\\'s Aliens (1986)... or better said copy, rip off, stealing. Or, how do they call it now... \"remake\", \"homage\". Yes, if you like some movie and its (virtual) reality, you\\'d like to spend more of your time \"in it\", but you can do it creatively (invent your own sci-fi world, or your own story, or your own extrapolation of the story), but you don\\'t copy everything word by word, scene by scene. Scene of the spaceship approaching planet (repeated more than three times of course), tough soldiers, colony on the planet, Ripley character, Hicks character, Newt-like character, Burke character, elevator scene, what more do we miss...? An alien!   Roland Emmerich is good at copying movies, but I prefer cocktails like Indepenedence Day - where more famous movies and their features are blended into one VFX spectacle. This small movie is not even a B-category. I developed a category of his own, for Mr. Director.   Regarding the \"gay interest\"... what do you mean? The wannabe-homoerotic electricity between Felix and Jake character? Yes, we all do dream :) Or the rape scene in the showers? Homosexuality = rape? Sexuality = violence? I might call it a hidden not-slightly homophobic remark...'\n",
      " b\"The nearest I ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a Gerard Philippe exposition in Paris about two years ago. I had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made I can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional, aimed at a long obsolete target. Hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all, Basil Rathbone, crossed foils with Errol Flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire. After a while you don't notice and revel in the Henri Jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the Prisoner Of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a tad better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate at the time. The print I saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a DVD version would enhance it.\"\n",
      " b'The original Thunderbirds earned a place in TV history. It was, and still is, much beloved - indeed, the entire first 10 minutes of the Wallace and Gromit movie (the Wererabbit) is a direct lift of Thunderbirds, down to a direct replay of the original Thunderbird 2 launching sequence (if you don\\'t believe me, get the movie, and then get a copy of the original episode where Thunderbird 2 is launched).  This movie was a crass attempt at making a kids\\' movie - when the original was loved and enjoyed by kids and adults alike! In the original, the Thunderbirds spent all of their time rescuing people who were often trapped when Mother Nature or Technology went horrible wrong (yes, there was also the occasional criminal act). The Thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward - the very essence of heroism and selflessness. There was little physical violence. The Thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree - how many of us would dream of someday building a Thunderbird 2? And don\\'t underestimate the power of entertainment to do this - many Japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robots to the old Astroboy cartoon.  But this movie was a poor re-image of the original. This movie came across as a meld between Thunderbirds and Loony Tunes - I mean, we have Anthony Edwards as Brain imitating Porky Pig\\'s stuttering????? Much of the action consists of Kung Fu/Power Rangers type fighting. Indeed, there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan. The tech that fired our imagination was absent - instead we have these kids running around, using a plot device that was NEVER in the original series (having the entire team take off at once, leaving the base occupied by the kids and Brain). Then there was a dose of \"Use the Force Luke\" mysticism thrown in when TinTin would levitate something or another, coupled with the The Hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\". About the only thing missing was for The Hood to go \"TinTin, I am your Uncle\" with a breath mask voice. The heart that made Thunderbirds unique was GONE.  The only bright point was Ron Cook\\'s portrayal of Parker - he caught it perfectly. But the actress playing Lady Penelope came across as a child - HUH????   And this is why we hate this movie. When someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base, and expects the fans to shell out money to watch, and then delivers something than wasn\\'t even close to what the fans expect - well, I am sorry, that is just plain WRONG! OK, so if they were making a kids\\' movie - fine - next time distribute it straight to video, where many of these belong. But don\\'t package something up in a familiar wrapper and change the innards.'\n",
      " b\"First, before reading further, you must understand that I'm not neo-nazi, I'm just trying to understand correctly Hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again.  I've seen this series and found it awful. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler wasn't angry all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even when he is a child. Second, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, it is highly probable that Hitler, in reality, was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret. Third, people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. That's a common point I found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him (of course, not Jews).  This series was awful because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, and of course, not charming at all, you're wrong. If you think that, you will let people like him take power in countries and you don't want that. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get into power, and stop thinking he was just awful, you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember he was elected) and stop theme before it's too late.  Life is important to protect, this series is just awful to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler like that, another one will take place exactly as the first did.\"\n",
      " b'I saw the movie \"G\" last night 10/29/05 and I feel like we paid $7.50 too much. This movie should have been at the A$1.00 movie. It reminded me of an independent movie with bad actors and a thin watered down plot. Maybe the writers and producers just got out of film school...I don\\'t know. This movie had a slow start and I thought that it was going to get a little interesting in the middle and then it had a weird ending. Everybody in the movie theater were complaining. Lots of things didn\\'t make sense. It seemed like it had the potential to be good but it just wasn\\'t happening. The characters seemed so unreal. The ending was something that I didn\\'t understand- there were a lot of loose strings that needed to be tied together. I expected a lot better from Blair Underwood. He was the reason I really wanted to see the movie in the first place. We should have gone to see \"SAW 2\" like we originally intended in the beginning.'\n",
      " b\"This is the BEST version of this story, by far. Others have tried but failed. In my opinion, Colin Firth is the ONLY and BEST Mr. Darcy to have ever played the role. The rest of the supporting cast are fantastic and amazingly realistic. The pace of the story is brilliant without cutting out too much of the detail to the plot. (I think this might be a reason why this mini-series blows away all of the other tries at doing this story in movie format).  A true classic! Grab some wine and cheese and spend a night or two watching this wonderful mini-series. You will want to own it in order to have more Pride and Prejudice evenings with the girls (or guys) in the future.  A MUST have for anyone's DVD collection!\"\n",
      " b\"I say: See this movie at least twice. First time I saw it was at the Philadelphia Film Festival. I laughed quite a bit... I thought Wilbur's subtle words of wisdom were rather funny. Second time I saw it was about a week later once the Ritz Theater's had picked it up. I sat there and saw the movie as being much more sad. I still found certain parts of it to be funny... but I saw it as a much darker film than I'd initially thought. The little nuances of the actors and actresses in the movie make it into an absolutely down-to-earth film; they just seem like normal people... a bit nutty, but totally believable... you'll think you knew them by the end.  I highly recommend seeing it if you get the chance... Make the effort. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll smile.  Added: And now I've got it on DVD. Diagnosis... wow. It's just so sad and real.\"\n",

So far I'm only half way through, and am fascinated by the story, but the people in it, let it down, I just hope it gets better by the end, as I can't not know what it's all about. Although, some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook, indicate everything is backwards, i.e. Dog is God, Live is Evil etc... just seems a little obvious at the moment, yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning, (As yet anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I'll update this post, but if your reading this, then well......

      " b\"Something of a labour of love, Colour Me Kubrick is a short biopic of con-man Alan Conway who successfully posed as Stanley Kubrick during the director's lifetime. Played by John Malkovich at his most enduringly camp, Conway charms the socks, money and underpants from a string of wealthy suckers and gay young men. A master of his game, he gets people to write large cheques to cover fictitious donations to charity dinners as readily as conning twenty quid off a rock band to buy them (and him) fags and alcohol.  Wildly exuberant and certainly colourful, the film is well directed and acted. Its main shortcoming are two fold. The plot, such as it is, comprises a series of extended sketches until Conway's eventual apprehension, which lends an air of repetitiveness. Secondly, although Malkovich's intensely colourful campness is a remarkable achievement, he stage centres in practically every scene and if you cannot fall completely in love with it, the effeminate preening eventually can look dated and rather irritating.  Colour Me Kubrick is a traditional camp comedy with lots of cross-references for film fans. If you enjoy the first five minutes you will love it, otherwise it may have you climbing the walls.\"\n",
      " b'Richard Schickel\\'s 1991 documentary about Gary Cooper - \"Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend\" gives us a look at the tremendous, all-American star through his films and his life. Narrated by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely \"Gary Coooper, American\" as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in westerns, and scenes from \"Meet John Doe,\" \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, and \"Sgt. York.\" The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos, showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life. There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper on \"The Jack Benny Show\" doing the comeback on the number \"Bird Dog\" - and Benny loses it. The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with Patricia Neal, which nearly ruined both their lives.  There\\'s a certain cohesiveness missing from this bio/retrospective - it jumps around a lot and has no footage of Cooper being interviewed, which would have added a lot. Also, Clint Eastwood\\'s narration was described as unobtrusive. What it was, was boring and monotone. Given that Cooper himself tended to be the strong, silent type on screen, we could have used a little animation.  On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever lived - there were some looks at him in his early films, but not nearly enough for this fan. That smile, those lips, that bone structure - he was handsome throughout his life, but in films like \"Morocco\" and \"Desire,\" he is devastating. Instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances, as Howard Roark in \"The Fountainhead,\" giving a speech that he admitted to the author he did not understand - a young, suave Cooper in a tux would have been a nice touch. This documentary, alas, was definitely produced by a man.'\n",

The acting (and I use that term VERY loosely) is abysmal, someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film?? Don't waste your time watching this. Hostel was a better film by some way.

Leaving a trail of crossed stems and broken glass, they spend their passage enjoying their last moments on the earth.  To be honest, I was more impressed with the secondary actors in their roles than Francis and Powell. Aline MacMahone is so regal and beautiful as the fake countess. She really knows how to put over a comedy line and she never seems overly tough. Frank McHugh has some great comic moments and provides an extra dimension to the film. Even Warren Hymer as the cop is rather good.  This is a sweet romance with great photography and snappy direction, a wonderful example of early 1930s film making.'\n",

He doesn't even look natural simply sitting and for the love of God someone get the boy some lip balm!

      " b\"First of all, I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american. Sure, there are moments when the U.S. are accused directly, like at the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they aren't naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this, for example.  But returning to the film itself, what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it. We find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this, with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness.  All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of September 11th. Thus, what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks, and this may make some people infuriated; but this is the world where we live, and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies, regardless of what presidents or priests may say us.  Finally, I think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened, and this movie could give some clues to them. This film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future, and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today.\"\n",

The first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced ? And being a TVM she answers that the reason is \" That people change \" rather than say something along the lines like \" I`m a right slapper \" or Your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex \" as does happen in real life divorce cases .

Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual but this time with such a beaten deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from Templar to liven him up.

The most anxious moment of the show must've been when Max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food! The ending was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the team make it.

After being thrown off and getting chased by Indians (or in today\\'s parlance, Native Americans), Roscoe stumbles into the town saloon where he foils robber St. John\\'s holdup and takes his guns.

      " b'To most people this movie is about a small town in the South. To me that one small town street is the place where my husband and I used to day dreaming about buying antique furniture after he would finish graduate school at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, Florida. The movie location, the one street town of Micanopy, is just a few miles away from Gainesville. They show the entire downtown! As I have watched Doc Hollywood umpteen times, I love to see the corner store, which was a jewelry store called the Strawberry Bank specializing in antique jewelry about seventeen years ago. I would put stuff on lay-way as graduate students could not afford the luxury of buying something faster. Then we would drive around those back roads full of trees and Spanish moss and eat an early dinner: fried cat fish, fried okra, rice, and whatever fresh thing they had that our small stomachs could contain. It was such a great time in our lives! That area is surrounded by students. I guess we did not realize how little we had as graduate students, since we were even able to afford an off-campus apartment! Everybody else had about the same youth and enthusiasm and we were looking to our bright futures. I would go to the library and get books on antiques furniture, old lace and antique jewelry. I would audit French classes, take classes in jewelry making techniques: such as lost wax and casting. I learned so much about life in that town, and biked until I ended up tan without ever sitting in the sun.  \\tLike Michael J. Fox (The American President) \"Dr. Benjamin Stone,\" I was fascinated with the big city. Coming from one of the largest cities in the world, I just wondered what I was going to do after I finished my classes as a Visiting Student at the UF. Well after living there for about four years, I learned much more than what graduate school could ever teach. Like Dr. Stone, I fell in love with the place, I would not mind having a pig named Jasmine, I fell in love with the quilt making, the silence, the southern hospitality, and how \"they all\" thought I had an accent. I can even do a pretty good southern accent now myself! Every once in while a celebrity would come to town like Sally Fields (Forest Gump) raising support for a project that her brother a physics professor at UF was working on. Those college folk, they sure come up with strange ideas. That was so cool!  Julie Warner (Mr. Saturday Night) \"Lou\" was so adorable with her down to earth attitude. I loved to see the Mayor dressed like a squash. That is the South! This is an excellent movie. It has values. Ben Stone realized that being a Doctor in a small town might even mean having to read to your clients personal letters to them because they could not read. He in the end realizes that being needed is far more important than money. My favorite quotes: \" Watch your language Doc, you are in the belt of the Bible belt.\" Stone: \"There were cows in the middle of the road! I told you my insurance company will be happy to pay for that fence.\" Judge:\"I built that fence myself. Neither you, nor, your insurance company can pay for a fence that I built myself.\" My favorite scenes: the one street in Micanopy, the cute wooden cabin, the little old ladies quilting and arguing. Ben Stone and Lou driving around on that old huge ambulance, and acting like real animals demarcating their territories by scent. They would urinate and distribute the liquid around to detract deer that would attract the hunters. My husbands favorite scene is Julie Warner slowing rising from under water when she was skinny dipping. Not lewd, but enchanting. Well we are going to \"visit all \" the relatives down south and eat fresh catfish in some back road \"ma &pa restaurant.\" I guess \" you all\" have to go buy or rent this movie.'\n",
      " b\"As an Army veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam war. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap is an understatement. If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But it was taken seriously my many people, especially overseas. Silly as it sounds, wherever I went in Europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic, muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW's. In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats. And he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm. I could go on, but I'm getting a headache. I gave this a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than Rambo III.\"\n",
      " b'MBW is one of those movies that is humorous because the characters are kinda stupid but funny. Kennedy plays the seemingly stereotypical role of \"black-wannabe-gangsta-trapped-in-white-boy\\'s-body\", but i think we\\'ve seen this role in movies quite too often (actually Mitch Mullany did a better job in The Breaks). The definitely could\\'ve done a better job w/ the plot line, but I suppose they did a good job by using the equation character stupidity = loads of laughs. I think they made Kennedy\\'s character more stupid than he deserved to be. Then again, the whole movie I think was just a big tease about how a lot of kids nowadays (whether from the \\'hoods of Compton or Malibu) are trying to emulate the lifestyles/persona of real hip-hop stars. It was a silly yet funny movie, I think more of the \"crack-up-laughing\" kind of movie vs. lighthearted humor (like Sandler\\'s Anger Management). So yes, don\\'t expect a strong story but go there for the laughs. One note though, they should\\'ve made Snoop Dogg\\'s dialogue more like the way he really talks/raps...it seemed a bit \"censored\" to me...perhaps they did it to make the PG-13 cut. For shizzos, my nizzos. Don\\'t be hatin\\'! :)  ** out of 5 for storyline ***** out of 5 for laugh factor'\n",
      " b'Yes, as unbelievable as it may be, in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for best picture - and it was the third musical to win that award in a five-year period, the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! however is that Oliver! is immeasurably better! No comparison. The first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust Oliver!. The acting is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dancing is great. This movie is dynamic, topical, relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs of New York, Oliver! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century London, England that evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! The other actors and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.'\n",
      " b\"I just saw a copy of this movie and it was awful. Nice camera work and clean edits made for a vast comparison with the weak plot and horrible acting by these b-movie stars. The only thing one could hope for is to see Kristy Swanson get naked, which she didn't even do (three years after her Playboy shoot she has packed on a few more pounds which is probably the reason!)  To even think of this movie as a thriller is impossible: the focus is more on the Baldwin and Swanson characters rather than developing a true thriller plot of who is killing all these people.  Overall don't waste two hours of your time, life is far too valuable.\"\n",
      " b\"Well its about time the Philippines made a movie and not stick to the old American formula, of the illness of the week syndrome.  This film did not shock you every few minutes, or give you eccentric characters. It went at a pace where life just goes on. We were shown the life in the village and the people living there.  I would of liked to see the reasons the older brother did not like school, and a bit more of Magnificoes friend, but overall it was a good film. Like Milan, the powers that be are thinking about the story a bit more. In the past Filipino films have been guilty of getting a thin story and stretching it for the film star. For example, do we have a role where Sharon Cuneta can cry? Ther was not a bad performance in the whole film, the father with his Rubic's cube, the mother with her pain, the grandmother who just wants to be a grandmother, and Magnifico who just wants to be a...boy.\"\n",
      " b'I was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of \"Girlfight\". It\\'s an Indie; low-budget, no big-name actors, freshman director. I had heard it was good, but not this good.  Placed in a contemporary, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day-do-day struggles of urban Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers, getting in trouble with the school and her friends. She is being raised by her single father, who appears to love her and her brother, but applies a strict, sex-based double standard on his children. The father\\'s double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, is taking boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar pursuits. On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny doesn\\'t like boxing, so he and Diana trade places; he gets the money from Dad then gives it to Diana to take the lessons in his place.  This is actually a feel-good movie, as Diana grows and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious issues head-on. There\\'s no giggly, \\'everything that can go right does go right\\' resolution a la \"Bend It Like Beckham\". The reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions, but in my opinion, \"Girlfight\" is a better and more satisfying film for it.'\n",
      " b\"After the atomic bomb hits Hiroshima, charred bodies lie all around, deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who can't even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. This black and white film, however sad and scary, is not without humor. The story revolves around a young woman Yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. She is trying to get married, but everyone keeps dying, and people are worried the same will happen to her. After finding a suitable mate (who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long), she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. This film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on Japan, it will frighten you, and will perhaps make you cry. The acting is good, not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made.\"\n",
      " b\"Having seen 'only' about 200 Hong Kong films in my time, I have to say this film is among my very top favorites. Not only is the plot engaging (and in some ways surprising, which these days is rare for any movie), but the chemistry between the two lead actors is superb. Top notch casting! And while often even the most serious HK films tend to insert quite a bit of humor in between all the drama and action, often spoiling the mood a bit, here the jokes are kept subtle and woven into the plot, even improving character relations. The music is also very well done, and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of the HK special Edition, they've even cleaned the picture (first release was grainy) and the subtitles, even if the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). All in all, if you have to see a HK film that isn't directed by John Woo or have Chow Yun Fat in it, this should be at least on your short list! A truly fascinating and entertaining watch!\"\n",
      " b\"This movie really surprised me. I had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute.   It is maybe not for the action seeking audience but for those that like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover and husband. If you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content this really is not for you.   The storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes, but in the end I think it made everything better. The ending was unexpected since you were almost fouled to think it would end otherwise.   As for the acting I think it was good. It will not be up for an Oscar award for long but it at least caught my eye. Gil Bellows portrait of a prison man is not always perfect but it is very entertaining. Shaun Parkes portrait of Bellows prison mate Clinique is great and extremely powerful. On the downside I think I will put Esai Morales portrait of Markie.  Take my advice and watch this movie, either you will love it or dislike it!\"\n",
      " b\"I had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end... having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom. What really horrifies me, I mean truly disturbs me, is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as 'delightful' or a 'must see.' I would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants.  The truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten. It is decidedly unfunny, poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold, canned rice pudding. To be kind to Ms Kramer, the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity, for having read the synopsis before I watched it, I had expected something more challenging. The possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co-dependence, the unexpected awakening of 'sisterly' sexuality, and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry (for the affections of the same girl) were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration, yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from.  Instead, the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations, with clich\\xc3\\xa9d characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction. The lack of directorial control seems astounding; on the one hand, Moynahan, Cavanagh and Spacek all give very pedestrian performances, while Heather Graham and Molly Shannon - the latter in particular - veer towards embarrassing over-compensation at times. One could lay the blame for this on the director - maybe Sue Kramer hopes that if her actors over-act, they will force a bigger laugh from the audience. But then again, the cast is a veteran one; one would expect them to do better.  Sue Kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make, and for whom. Given the possible issues Gray Matters alludes to, and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy, perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead. I know it is never easy to make films about women and women's issues, especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone, but whatever direction she takes, inconsequential and flimsy characters like Gray are not going to cut mustard.\"\n",
      " b\"This is BY FAR the best Bruce Lee documentary I have ever seen for two reasons: they consentrate on more of his philosophical beliefs rather than his life story, and they show GAME OF DEATH!!! That was the real reason I watched it. They found Bruce Lee's original outline and stunt moves for the film, and also all of the footage cut for the 1979 version. They put it all together now in the order it was supposed to be in and the result is AWESOME!! The nunchakaus scene is sweet! And the fight with Kareem is cool as well. A must-see for any Bruce Lee fan.\"\n",
      " b'First off, I never got into Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (pun intended) since it was never \"big\" here in the US as it is everywhere else.  That said, I must say (obviously) that after finishing the 2nd season, that this is one of the best sci-fi shows I\\'ve ever seen.  Now, I watch a lot of Sci-Fi shows from all over and this show stands out.  The first season was tops to begin with, with Christopher Eccleston in the title role and I thought he was terrific. Of course, so was the lovely Billie Piper who just adds such humanity and warmth to the character of Rose that no one could\\'ve done it better. Let\\'s not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey/Ricky who are just a blast to watch. Then there\\'s David Tenannt. At first, I thought he was too gawky-looking to play the character (his ears!!), but after watching the 2nd season, he fits in just fine. His sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless. He\\'s great with snappy dialog and can turn serious without batting an eye.  Aside from the great acting from the cast is the acting from most of the guest actors that have appeared. A lot of them are veteran actors but some are new to me and are damn fine.  The production and direction of the show is top notch. Occasionally, there\\'ll be some cheesy effects here and there, but that\\'s always been a factor in the original series and, like those episodes, is negligible.  My favorite thing of all about the series: The stories. Writing folks, is always the key to great entertainment. Russell T. Davies has written many of the episodes along with a few other writers and they have done an excellent job. They\\'ve managed to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialog. I also appreciate the fact that they can breach the older Doctors\\' past story lines and enemies well (my friend explains much of this to me while we watch the show) and respectfully.  I won\\'t mention anything about the 2nd season and how it ends since the Sci-Fi channel just started airing the 2nd season.  I wouldn\\'t want to spoil it. It\\'s so much fun and excitement. You\\'ll never want to take your eyes away nor miss a word of dialog.  It really is that good.  PS: Thanks to the producers for Nicholas Briggs back! **EXTERMINATE!**'\n",

It was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional!!!!!  What I liked about this movie: It was sooo nice!!!!! It was a very good sports movie, ala \"The Mighty Ducks\" trilogy. It had also taken moviegoers across Texas, from somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso all the way to the Metroplex (where I live). I can tell because I recognize that ballpark (was \"The Ballpark in Arlington;\" now it\\'s \"Ameriquest Field\")! It was nice to see Disney\\'s \"Golden Age\" end here in my area!!!!!  R.I.P.

      " b'How to explain \"?\" is almost an oxymoron in its own right, just by the name itself.  On its surface the comedy and plots are in your face, crass and direct. But, underneath its loud bark is an even more impactful bite. The humor is deep and serves to address important, yet rarely talked about issues in the world today.  \"?\" is a film that needs to be digested two or three times if one is to capture all its neunces, subplots and overt comical jabs at society.  If you have a strong stomach, and a love for twisted humor, you should own this film, otherwise, go buy another copy of Harry Potter or the Toy Story.'\n",
      " b\"Oh man...talk about a stinker of an awful atrocity of an excuse for entertainment. You know, this movie epitomizes everything that is wrong in the movie industry today -- just stick together a bunch of good looking big name celebrities with tons of web sites devoted to them together with a hip soundtrack and see what they can pull off. This entire story seems like it was written by a fifteen year old. Worse yet, a moronic fifteen year old. Honestly. And all there is to blame for this absolute mess of a terrible film is MTV. It seems to me that the only people this movie would appeal to are those absolutely void of any semblance of a brain, because this movie is kind of like a slow-growing fungus. It starts off seemingly harmless, a bit annoying, but tolerable. But it keeps growing and growing and there is never any hope in sight except to mercifully kill it or yourself.  In the movie's feeble defense, all of the performances are very good, particularly Christina Ricci (good as always, I suppose) and the girl from wings. But nobody can save this junker. Save yourself two hours and seven bucks and just go stare at a wall for two hours. At least your mind will wander and your brain will be somewhat stimulated.\"\n",
      " b'Basic summary: Ipswitch used to be a community of witches and escaped the Salem witch hunts by forming a covenant of secrecy. The first born males descended from these families have supernatural powers, and must come to terms with the seductive, addictive nature of using those powers.  Well, I usually give movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5, going from there:  Production: -1 for very obvious audio out of sync, +1 for nicely done special effects, the darkling actually gave me chills, +0.5 for nice colorization (I like the dull blue), -0.5 for the stupid sound track, +0.5 for the opening sequence -- I\\'m a sucker for stylish compositing and flashy title design.  Story / Script: +1 for decent main idea, -0.5 for DBZ/Matrix/Street Fighter ripoff/pastiche, -1 for not explaining some plot threads very well (spiders, darkling), -1 for boring, predictable ending, -1 for gratuitous exposition, both as words on the screen and as bland monologuing  Acting / Characterization: -0.5 for bad bad acting, although it gets a little better as the film progresses, -1 for lack of character development, especially among all the females  Other: +1 for gratuitous male and female nudity, which is fun to watch, and +0.5 for no sex scenes, which for this genre are usually done very badly and end up being boring rather than hot, +1 for hitting its target audience, teenage sci-fi/horror/thriller fans, even though this movie is not exclusively any of those genres.  Conclusion: This is not a \"film,\" this is a MOVIE. There\\'s really nothing to analyze, it\\'s just good, (relatively) clean fun. Lots of really attractive actors and actresses. Lots of boys fighting in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects, and/or mindlessly fun plots, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar-worthy, exquisitely-produced film masterpieces with tons of multi-layered, allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques, you probably won\\'t like this film.  Using my twisted logic, this movie gets a 4/10.'\n",
      " b\"I usually steer clear of TV movies because of the many ways you know that it's TV movies five seconds into the picture. This one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy, well-crafted mood that is established from the very start. While the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (even if claiming to be set in California the movie was largely shot around a stormy Vancouver, B.C.), the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement Olmos' excellent acting.\"\n",
      " b'\"Silverlake Life\" is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward. Actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illuminations, see something else. And it\\'s by no means a tearjerker. But I mean that in positive ways. It shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with AIDS is affecting the quality of their every-day lives. It\\'s almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not, because it was so undressed that I had to look for other ways to respond. It\\'s an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents I\\'ve ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes Hollow-wood productions on AIDS seem hip and heartless. These men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings \"You are My Sunshine\" to Mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing.'\n",
      " b'This is by far the worst Hemingway adaptation ever. Rock Hudson was badly miscast and entirely unbelievable as a hard-bitten soldier/adventurer drawn to war. Jennifer Jones was far too old for her part and Vittorio de Sica seemed to think he was acting in some other movie altogether. They tried to make a large-scale epic out of a low-key romantic novel and the result is terrible. As if that were not enough the whole thing is so slow, overlong and dated that it is practically unwatchable. Rock must have kicked himself for turning down \"Sayonara\" and \"Ben Hur\" in order to make this ghastly crap.  0/10. To be avoided.'\n",
      " b'If I could give this movie a negative rating, I would have.  I loved Dana Carvey on SNL. He was funny, had great timing. He did a great job in the Wayne\\'s World movies too. He worked great when his movies stayed within the 15-30 demographic.  Then he destroyed his career with the Master of Disguise.  This \\'comedy\\' was so bad that it made me feel terrible just for watching it. I was embarrassed to be watching this movie in public. There\\'s nothing funny about openly pitying an actor as you watch him force the run time to 80 minutes with jokes so flat they don\\'t even register above the painfully boring dialog.  \"Painful\" is a good way to describe this movie. Nothing works. Sometimes you can\\'t even tell when the jokes had happened. That\\'s how bad they were. I watched this with my brother and found myself asking \"was that supposed to be a joke?\" I guess so, because it happened over and over again.  I don\\'t find his fake Italian accent as annoying as many of the reviewers, but how the hell is repeating the word \"turtle\" over and over again while dressed in a turtle suit to get into a turtle club supposed to be funny, let alone plausible in the plot? Was everybody involved with the film consistently drunk as this was being made? Surely somebody must have said something like \"Guys, this really sucks. Lets burn it and never speak of it again.\" I suggest anybody who accidentally came into possession of this bumbling nightmare do the same, to rid the world of its horrors forever.'\n",

One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.\"\n",
      " b'This is a film for entertainment; I did not think the world made social commentary from one small film. I personally find this film funny, audacious, and memorable. It is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a Princess. This film was done very well I might add, in the 70\\'s a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person\\'s sexuality. This movie is not about a person being homosexual or not, it is however about love, in all it\\'s strange forms. This film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70\\'s in Hollywood, or in California. Pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men. Women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. Bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community.  THEN the fantasy begins!! Let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have? Well this movie, which in ANY way was better than that dismal redo \"The Next Big Thing\". Perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better.  I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70\\'s and it still brings a smile to my lips now. I heartily advise anyone who wants a funny, tender movie- to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun. Some people need to lighten up!!! And this is the film you should do it with!  '\n",
      " b'Surely this was filmed 100 years ago? It was certainly another world. The innocence and kindheartedness of nearly all the people in the film is what strikes this cynic the most.  The promoters who accepted they were going to \"take a big bath\" when they realised they had to take down the fences and make it a free concert for safety reasons.   The landowner who can\\'t believe the amount of people who have come to his farm  The locals cheerfully giving food and water to the kids and commenting about how respectful they are  The kids going to a music festival but for some reason expecting and getting so much more - and then queuing to phone home and tell the parents they\\'re okay!   The performers who knew something special was happening and did their bit to make history.   At more than 3 hours the film could have seemed too long but it doesn\\'t as the performances and interviews with concert-goers mix perfectly. There are few interviews with the performers as the director recognises it was really all about the kids.  It would be interesting to see present day interviews with people in the film to see their current day view on what happened at Woodstock but in the meantime we can only enjoy this living piece of history.'\n",

Then, over to this movie. In fighting movies, I usually don\\'t care about story at all. But here, I just had to. It was so bad that I just couldn\\'t believe it. Things seem to happen without a specific reason. For example, I never could figure out why the bad guy (Bender) was bad. He just did what he did, without proper explanation. The fighting is bad too. Many of the fight scenes include use of knives, it was too much of that in my opinion. And when it comes to the final scenes, that was so typical B-action. It was also so extremely bad that i sat and laughed through it. That\\'s really not a sign of quality, especially in a movie that totally lacks self-irony.'\n",

This movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of W.W.II because of the perception of the nearness of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment. And what after life? I liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer-a typical British judge-), Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesey) defending Peter Carter (David Niven) and also June (Kim Hunter) against the American prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I -there is a reason why it is an American-). It is all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real \"tour-de-force\". The message of the movie is clear: in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans. The way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any Hollywood-movie could ever make.'\n",
      " b\"I, too, saw this film at the Berlinale, and though the matter of rape was treated with maturity and frankness, the film itself was constructed poorly. More than anything, it was bland - camera placement and cuts were standard fare, non-diagetic sound was near non-existent, and the dialogue was highly unrealistic, comprising of long, drawn-out pauses interspersed with briefly-spoken lines.  The upshot of this was that I felt no attachment to the characters beyond a basic sympathy for their current predicaments - dialogue was stretched out to the point of losing its emotional resonance, and many lines were delivered with little feeling from the actors. I was particularly unconvinced by Sabine Timoteo's performance, whose talent restricted her to screaming rather than actual crying. Compared to Claire Dane's stunning depiction of anguish in Romeo and Juliet, I felt wholly unsatisfied by her performance.  It was these factors that made the characters feel less than human, failing to imbue them with life. This, coupled with the utterly bland direction and editing, meant that I felt no attachment to them, and I was left gagging for each coming line of dialogue purely to provide a break from the silent, expressionless moments in between. Drawing out the narrative to over two and a half hours simply rubbed salt in the wound.  The Free Will was not in itself awful, but there were so few points of interest that I found myself becoming restless within forty minutes, and when the credits rolled in what will doubtless be considered a brilliantly emotional finale, I still felt little attachment to the characters.\"\n",

Featuring performances from puppets and actors both that delight in each sublimely ridiculous situation, this one is fun for the whole family. It holds up very well after all these years, and you won't be disappointed.\"\n",
      " b\"Fell in love with this show the first time I watched it. I watched the dub and I gotta say I loved it. Later I would watch the sub but didn't find it as appealing. The English version is best for people who don't know Japanese. The type of anime that it is just makes it more entertaining to hear in English. It's a great show and yes the dub may not be 100% accurate or great but you can relate to the characters emotions when in English. The new DVD dub is kinda dry. I prefer the VHS dub which are more laid back and well the voices bring out the characters a lot better. The DVD was re-dubbed because a few seconds of episode 2 where nagisa gropes shuns younger brother were cut out in the dub but left in the sub VHS. This isn't a dirty anime or something. It's a well funny light hearted type of anime that if you liked series like tenchi muyo etc would love.\"\n",
      " b\"As the title says, this movie IS excess baggage in your video collection. The idea of the film isn't (at) all bad, only the resulting movie just lacks about everything in all areas; the dialogue is horrible, Silverstone is no actress and by the looks of this film will never become one either. Benicio del Turro oughtta be ashamed of his work. Never in the film does one believe in the relationship between the two main characters. As a matter of fact, I could have said it better in one brief statement: don't watch this film. Period.\"\n",
      " b'If you lived through the 60s, this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous. It\\'s all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time. These are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out: \"don\\'t speak too soon for the wheel\\'s still in spin, for the times they are a-changin\\'\". While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and it\\'s dissemination at the time, that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia, influencing engineers, scientists and aiding in the hyper-development of computer related activities. A salute to the filmmakers from one who was there - you\\'ve captured the era better than I\\'ve seen before.'\n",
      " b'I first read the novel by Jackie Collins and I thought what a fantastic book, not Shakespeare obviously, but definitely a page turner. When I finished it I thought it would make a great movie. Little did I know it was already turned into a movie. I have to admit I was a little nervous about seeing the movie, as movie adaptations are usually always not as good as the book, and especially TV movies are usually pretty low on talent and budget. I finally tracked this movie down on DVD on ebay, and in spite of the negative reviews on IMDb, I really enjoyed it. While reading the novel I had images of what the characters looked like and for the most part the movie did a great job. I thought Melissa Gilbert as Taylor Singer was great, always loved her, Robin Givens was OK, but Farrah Fawcett was definitely not who i would have chose. The Character in the book was closer to a cross between Madonna and Marylin Monroe. Farrah Fawcett was definitely way too old for the part and looked weathered, tired and haggard much of the time, the rest of the time she had about a pound of makeup on and wore clothes 20 years too young for her.  However I thought the movie was great. If your trying to take the movie seriously and looking for quality, then this movie probably deserves 2 stars, however, if your looking for some trashy, guilty pleasure, camp entertainment then this movie scores. This movie is a basic cable CBS movie of the week, yet its trying to be hip, edgy and sexy, like an HBO/skinamax movie. This is what makes this movie so enjoyable. It opens with Farrah Fawcett finishing up her make up, (which looks like bondo!!) and doing a truly jaw dropping Vanity Fair cover shoot. Farrah writhes and touches herself and mugs for the camera so unashamedly that you just cant help but laugh. She is just too old to be playing a drop dead sexy pop star! The story line weaves together Farrah\\'s story with that of her 2 other Hollywood wife friends. Melissa Gilbert plays an ex actress now married to a prominent producer. Shes trying to write a script and turns to a 20 something hunk writer, who we see for the first time naked, save for a conveniently draped bed sheet. Melissa Gilbert is wonderful to watch as shes very eager to shed her safe image, and we she her talking about oral sex at lunch, taking her top off (back to the camera) and going to bed with her hunk numerous times and eventually acting in Showtime movie about lesbians!!. Farrah Fawcett in the mean time is dealing with an abusive husband who is sleeping with other women and using her as meal ticket. One shocking scene has Farrah getting slapped round by her husband in their bedroom, he throws her on the bed and then unzips his pants practically in her face,(hinting at forced oral sex) She later develops a relationship with a private investigater whom she hires. Robin Givens the last of our Hollywood wives has basically no part, and is mere filler. She is always talking about how wonderful she is and how she is adored by her fans, and is definitely a diva.  The movie looks fabulous. All the women get to look fantastic. In every scene they are dressed to the nines and fully made up. The all drive expensive cars, live in luxurious homes and are filthy rich. The acting is pretty low, which adds to the trashiness. One scene between Farrah and her daughter is pretty shocking because of how bad the acting is. Farrah is supposed to be trying to give advice to her daughter about some man trouble, but cant find the right thing to say. Farrah acts like she forgot the dialogue and stumbles over her words and makes gestures that are so amateurish and lame, it looks like a scene off a blooper real!! Seeing Farrah try to act like a sex symbol and sing like a pop star (she lip syncs worse than Susan Hayward in Valley of the Dolls) makes this a so bad its good movie. The dialogue is full of hilarious profanity( remember its a TV movie so the characters go around saying \"Bitch, Son of a Bich, ass, and bastard\" as much as possible to make the movie sound edgy!! By the middle of the movie your wanting someone to say F***!!!!) The storyline keeps the viewer involved and has some twists and suspense as it gets to the end.  If your a fan of trashy movies like Valley of the Dolls and movies that showcase an aging actress in a role too young for her, than this is def worth a look! Like the book this movie is mere entertainment and not some Academy Award winning art film!! If you watch this movie for some fun it won\\'t disappoint!!!'\n",
      " b\"Just been on sci-fi channel UK, 5th July, its was ****. Shame on JRD! May be he was bored one week ! He cant be skint after LOTR. I suppose he wasn't to blame. Mr Sheppird was. I turned off after 50 minutes, couldn't bear it. The cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5 foot bat. Who funded this project? I think the whole thing must have cost $250 bucks. Avoid at all costs, don't think about buying the DVD if they release one, I cant imagine they would spend dollars on producing one. Lets hope someone makes a decent Chupra film and a decent BIGFOOT movie. Sasquatch was okay, poor Lance. Its a shame a big studio and direct wont risk it, no more super hero films please!\"\n",
      " b'Take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail. They\\'re not the faces of Hollywood extras. Somebody in production was really smart to take filming to Oxford, Mississippi, because you can\\'t get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot. Scope out the narrow dusty roads, the frozen earth beneath, and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on. No wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving; they\\'re just reflecting the soil from which they spring. Old man Lucas (Hernandez) better fear for his life, but then he springs from that same hard earth.  The movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense. Old man Lucas is not very likable. He\\'s a victim and we sympathize, but he\\'s also haughty and unfriendly. Wisely, the script refuses to sweeten him up. That way we\\'re forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic. The script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective. Instead, we\\'re shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death. So, it\\'s through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed, a much more effective pathway. It also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the Jim Crow system.  Note how the movie doesn\\'t attack segregation. It\\'s doubtful that old man Lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there\\'s no hint that even lawyer Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the color line except to see justice done. No, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid (Jarman) whose head is not yet filled with \"notions\". He\\'s not exactly friends with Lucas, but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek. The last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle, the lawyer, instead of his more hidebound parents (the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked). The lawyer might not join a future civil rights march, but the kid might. That\\'s the movie\\'s realistically hopeful side.  There was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period, 1949-51, (The Well, No Way Out, Home of the Brave, Lost Boundaries). Even famously detached MGM got into the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, the McCarthy purges in Hollywood put an end to \"problem\" films that might not serve Cold War ends. Even so, each of these is worth catching up with, not only because they\\'re good movies, but because even with the passage of 60 years and Jim Crow, they\\'re still relevant.'\n",
      " b'Having been allowed behind the scene access during this tour, I have to say that everything you see in these videos truly portrays JJ Cale in the most accurate way possible.  The film moves slow, sometimes to the point of boring. But, that\\'s the \"laid back\" feel you\\'re supposed to get. Waiting for a train to pass, sitting in a parking lot playing guitar. This is the calm, relaxed way John leads his life. Definitely something to look up to considering his financial wealth.  The interviews with Eric Clapton are great. He puts Cale on a pedestal (so to say) and credits him properly. I admire that.  This film has finally been released in the US as well and definitely worth a look for those interested in the Tulsa Sound, the roots of popular music, and of course, JJ Cale himself.'\n",
      " b'An \"independant\" film that, from the back of the box, promises twists, adventure and an emotional adventure we will never forget. This film also fools us into watching it by flaunting Rachel Lee Cook with a starring role. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie is going to give you NOTHING. The story goes on aimlessly, revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested. All three \"disturbed\" characters have only small grains of back story to force us to care. Just as you reach the end, everything about the story is altered and instead of helping the audience catch up, you are left with no idea, and more importantly, no interest in \"why\". The director, who also thought it would be a good idea to co-star, seems to come into the film with no prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking. The entire piece looks like a college \"art\" film crafted by a freshman film student trying to hide a lack of true talent.'\n",
      " b'Well the cover looked grate, but the film was pure sh.... Can\\'t say it nicer. Really who came up with such a stupid story. Other filmmaker in the world is trying to get funding, then people get money to make sh... like this? the people giving this film funding must really be angry and feeling misled. I mean a Hitler with transvestite attitude and jerking off while in the middle of a fight etc. This film should never have been made, it destroys the market for real filmmakers.   And what was used to film it, handy-cam? the story was a big bag of crap and the actors really could have been better, some OK, but the one playing \"Hitler\" have been doing to much school-plays or theater not film. Well he sucked anyway. A real waste of money. Well people should buy it and burn it.'\n",
      " b'Any fans of unintentionally hilarious action films are in for a treat, this film was a delightful, and I mean DELIGHTFUL piece of cheese.  As I picked it from a bargain bucket there were 3 things I spotted that gave it away; Ice-T for one, the tag line \"Kill the president, kill the hostages, escape. A great idea!\" which isn\\'t really much of a great idea considering it doesn\\'t mention making it away with millions in bearer bonds, it just promotes violence which is wrong for children, and Eric Roberts\\' smirking face.  When I sat down to watch it within minutes I was hooked, Ice-T angrily slamming his hands on the table like a bullied 5 year-old, Eric Roberts firing a harpoon into a block of wood, and some INTENSELY bad acting.   The quality in the film only continues to decrease, inexplicable decisions from the bad guy, good guy and a concerned looking Madsen (just watch his face when 3 S.W.A.T. guys plummet from the rooftop...) do nothing to help matters, and neither do the questionable stunt men, plot line, or fight scenes.. or special effects... or dialogue.. actually come to think of it how did this even get made? I propose there is some sort of official ratings board (of which I am a member) that decides if a film should get a stamp of abject disapproval, the likes of which this film thoroughly deserves.  Things to watch out for:  Eric Roberts - Watch this man like hawk. He gets battered by a woman (nothing against women, it just makes it funnier) and his stunt double is NOT CONVINCING.  The Flamethrower Bit - Out of nowhere the main bad guy produces a flamethrower, and just when you think you might get to see Eric Roberts in flames, it produces a measly flame which reaches about 2 feet, not exactly ideal with Roberts at the other end of a 30 foot (at least) corridor.  The Dummies - Two top-class dummy sequences here, the aforementioned S.W.A.T. team receive a spray of bullets from the bad guy with moments of abseiling from a chopper and we get to see 3 very competent looking dummies, twisting and turning the air this way and that.. One appears to have a leg straight out 90 degrees from this body, possibly part of S.W.A.T. training but don\\'t quote me on that  The second dummy sequence is the bad guy\\'s death (not that that can count as a spoiler since it was clearly going to happen, this is the \\'Nature of Die Hard\\' for crying out loud!). This is probably my favourite of the two. It requires THOROUGH analysis with your slow-motion button.   The bad guy falls backwards from the top-floor, but sadly we aren\\'t with him for his whole flight. We catch up with him probably only 50 or so feet from the ground. Looking like a ventriloquist\\'s dummy with a bad wig (even better when you\\'ve seen the guy we\\'re supposed to believe it is), it sort of hits the ground and crumples, and for the few bittersweet moments we see the dummy on the floor it looks more like a pile of clothes and hair than anything in the rough shape of a human, bones completely broken or not.  So yeah  Apologies for anyone expecting a proper review I just felt the need GET MY FEELINGS OUT THERE, no matter how incoherent.  10 out of 10!'\n",
      " b'Was lucky enough to view this at Sundance in Park City this past Monday morning in the Park City HS gym. Craig Lucas introduced the film and took questions after. The crowd was in awe of the acting, plot, the actual house where filmed etc. A wonderful film that hopefully will stun audiences. Patricia Clarkson, Peter Saarsgard and Campbell Scott were perfect in their roles. Was this purchased at Sundance? Is this subject matter going to make it on a national level with our present political situation so anti-gay? Mr. Lucas blasted our present president and our sorry political environment. He was thrilled with the film and the number of people in the audience at 9 in the morning. A treat of a film.'\n",
      " b\"it was a film that was absolutely perfect with not a mistake in sight!Oh so scary and frightening and hilarious rolled into one!But that goes for the experience at the movies1On DVD it lost that sense of scariness as the film is not knowing who is doing what and not knowing really what is going on.in the movies,you sit in darkness for 2 hours with up to 200 strangers.this added a sense of scariness to the film.that sense was lost on DVD.it still has the odd scare on DVDand is still hilarious but through out the film i felt a sense of loss.but i would still watch it over and over for entertainment value purely but to do with scare i don't think so.it might be different for people who ONLY saw it on DVD but for those in the UK and Ireland where it is still on release,see it in the cinema first.still highly recommended outside of movies though\"\n",
      " b\"This is the type of movie that makes you think.  Remember how you felt at the end (last 10 minutes) of the movie 6th Sense? Unearthed is a movie that will have you thinking the same way. Full of twists and turns, this movie gets better each time you see it.  Excellent performances by John Bernath (Voss) and Slake Counts (Pinder) make this a great movie for either Horror or Sci-Fi fans. It does not fit neatly into a genre category and as such defies traditional movie plots that seem all too predictable.  Well done and well worth the watch. Low budget doesn't have to mean bad movie any more. This is a film you will enjoy seeing more than once. Excellent Cinematography and a driving music score. Blood, guns, fast cars, alien warlords, dark cityscapes and women hanging on hooks.....what more could you ask for.  REVIEW BASED ON SCREENER COPY OF UNEARTHED 2005\"\n",
      " b\"As a fan of the extreme japanese cinema i was really excited to finally get my hands on this film. But it was simply not worth the wait. The film is very slow and boring and as a matter of fact i had to fast-forward most of the film. Also most of the film's action is in the last 30 minutes and even when you finally reach that point of the film you are simply not interested anymore. It would have been way better if they had cut out about 45 minutes of the film ! and also , the scene at the end where a guy goes crazy is far too long. we dont need to see the guy jumping up and down for 10 minutes to understand there is something wrong with him\"\n",
      " b\"As the film opens, two thugs kill another thug. When the body is discovered and about to be autopsied, the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead, he was also suffering from the Pneumonic plague--a very nasty and more virulent version of the Bubonic plague! So, it's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately, otherwise a disaster could erupt.  Oddly, I actually know quite a bit about the Pneumonic plague, as I taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes. The film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie. The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldn't have been allowed to show it. Sure, there is high fever and coughing (they got this right) but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood--along with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like you'd get with the Bubonic plague--all purply and gross! I can certainly understand why they didn't go this far. Also, I am sure that the federal government would have had a much, much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease--here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill-prepared and a bit dumb. No one seemed willing to believe the doctors!! As for the acting, the film had some excellent actors here. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are, respectively, the public health doctor and police chief. Good actors but also known actors back in 1950. However, in his first film is the very menacing Jack Palance (still going by his original moniker, 'Walter Jack Palance') as well as the relatively unknown (at the time) Zero Mostel. Palance was great--very scary and very physically adept in his own stunts. Mostel played a heavy typical of his early work--a greasy and cowardly sort of evil.  Overall, despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly, the film is very tense and has excellent acting--and is well worth seeing.\"\n",
      " b'Warning, Spoilers! ...but it was somewhat entertaining if only for the cheesiness factor. The story is one of the most predictable I\\'ve seen in a long time and the swordfights (if you can call them that) are beyond laughable, but nevertheless, both me and my SO spent an otherwise bored saturday night watching this made-for-tv drivel. People have compared this movie to the excellent \"The Princess Bride\" but as a slightly jaded and cynical viewer, I\\'d have to argue that \"The Princess Bride\" is a lot more enjoyable in every single aspect (swordfights - I weep when I even compare the two, dialogue, plot, characters, and just overall silliness) when compared to this movie. This movie is simply not as clever as \"The Princess Bride\" nor does it aspire to be, which works in some ways for its own made-for-tv charm.   It\\'s not horrendous by any means, but unless you\\'re bored silly, I wouldn\\'t rush out to see it either. My SO and I did get quite a few chuckles at several points in the movie, including the part where Froderick jumped in front of the Prince and saved his life (of course, the Sheriff happened to have only one arrow) and of course, the priceless \"You got egg in your beard\" line by Robin. Sure they had to use almost every medieval cliche in the book (including the worst kiss I\\'ve ever seen), but at least I didn\\'t pay to watch it. The cast was overall mediocre and the plot would amuse those under 12 or anyone who is gullible enough to believe two guys can escape unnoticed in the night and find a canoe and THEN go across the English Channel without oars. Overall 4/10'\n",
      " b\"Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.  Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century, 1945 to be exact, so there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. But it is just window dressing, the historic context is completely negligible.  Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom, loathing, delight, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars. She endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity. I wish some really good parts come along for her. She really deserves it.\"\n",
      " b\"I saw 'See Grace Fly' when it opened in the theaters in Vancouver. I adore this movie. One reason that I like it, is because it takes two controversial themes and sticks them together. Religion and mental illness are portrayed in such a way that I did not feel the urge to yell at the screen. That is very hard to do. I'm not a religious person, and this is one of my favorite movies. The cast does an amazing job. Gina Chiarelli as Grace is phenomenal. Her emotional struggle that progresses through the movie is heart wrenching. Paul McGillion who plays Grace's brother, Dominic, also adds to the power of the movie. He plays the repressed missionary brother who is trying to come to terms with many different aspects of his life...his mother's death, his missing sister, his faith. 'See Grace Fly' is a wonderful movie that I recommend very highly.\"\n",
      " b'The movie is a fantasy. The story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully. (I still cannot believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well.) Some of the dialog is wonderfully clever. The costumes made me feel as though I was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942.  Movies are designed to serve various purposes. This one is designed to entertain and it certainly does. If I have one negative comment it would be that Nelson Eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing Count. Some of the closeups made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing magnificently. However, Jeanette MacDonald was just as dazzling as ever. She makes a spectacular angel.  This genre is well before my time, and I an new to the Jeanette MacDonald/Nelson Eddy films and related conversation. The music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies, there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable, more delightful, better constructed. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see in the movie theaters today. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies. They say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is. And those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what? I think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten. There is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed. I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and great music.'\n",
      " b'Before any Westerner visits India for the first time, I strongly recommend them to view Outsourced prior to their arrival. The \"bread and butter\" of the movie is that there is so much one can learn by analyzing some of the customs and trends of Indian culture.   Outsourced is a very light-spirited venture about the life of an American sales manager who is prompted to make a business trip to India in order to train his replacements. All the characters are likable and the key situations that occur seem realistic. (Of course the majority of the cast is obviously Indian so it would make sense.) It was interesting to see the main character go through the transition from adjusting to vegetarianism, learning compassion through generosity, consciously eating with the right hand and other habits.  Being a good hearted film, the only thing outsourced lacks is some prolonged suspense. There is nothing too dramatic about the changes the main character had to go through other than his initial embrace to Indian life, a mild issue with an extra-marital affair, and the brief moment where he had to tell his trainees that they\\'ve been laid off. Everything seemed just a little too easy though I am aware it is in the culture of the supporting cast to positively adjust to change.  As said before, I would recommend this movie to any American or Western traveller to forewarn them of the culture shock that he/she would face. I\\'ve actually enjoyed this movie to my surprise.'\n",
      " b\"The acting was very sub-par, You had Costas Mandalar acting like Triple H's dumber forest ranger brother, a Scott McMahon look-alike as his depute who I guess your supposed to care about but there is no emotional involvement anywhere. You have the Stupid lesbian, Not that I have any thing against lesbians, i don't just stupid ones who keep running around in a punisher like shirt and a grunge like hat who keeps asking if anyone saw her dead lover.  The Villain could be scary and there is a morality tale somewhere about trying to fight age and death but it is lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley points out to the soon to be victims the way back into town, while obviously there are city lights behind him.  Also A mispronunciation of Ed Gein but pronounced it Gine. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We have had our share of Monsters Gein,Dahmer, and McCarthy, but if your going to use it pronounce it right.  God Why do i watch all these terrible films. Oh yes I am a glutton for punishment and I watch these so you don't have to.\"\n",
      " b'It probably wouldn\\'t be fair of me to say that this is the singularly worst movie of all time. However, it certainly does rank at the bottom of the pile.  I\\'ve read the comments published to date very carefully and seen comparisons made with classic movies such as HALLOWEEN. It would not be fair to compare this movie to such classics, however it is fair to compare it to contemporary movies made with similar budgets and similar premises.  As someone who loves straight-to-DVD movies like CAMP BLOOD and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE, I was expecting another \"so-bad-it\\'s-good\" movie in a similar vain when I put SERIAL SLAYER into my DVD player. What I saw on the screen was a long way departed from my expectations.  From the opening moments, this movie was obviously going to be very poor as production values go, but this did not mean it would be devoid of all merit. Indeed it could have been an unintentionally funny variation of HALLOWEEN if placed in the right hands.  Unfortunately, this movie just got worse and worse as it moved on. There is more padding than any armchair ever manufactured. In fact, the only movie I can think of with this level of padding is HG Lewis\\'s THE GRUESOME TWOSOME. However, the director of that movie did at least make some of the padding interesting to watch in the \"so-bad-it\\'s-good\" kind of way. At least 80 percent of SERIAL SLAYER consists of 3 women talking. Nothing happens at all. Hints are dropped that a stalker is creeping up on them but the producers lead this fabulous premise to absolutely nothing. As another commenter has correctly pointed out, the movie keeps stalling like a dysfunctional road vehicle. Just when it appears that something interesting is transpiring, the action comes to a halt and the seemingly never-ending boring conversations between the 3 main characters resume. Only in the last 10 minutes does anything remotely interesting happen but by this time most viewers will have given up on the endurance of watching this movie.  Judith O\\'Dea of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD fame must have really needed some money to supplement her retirement pension when she made this because this is the most embarrassing production any actress of her ilk could have appeared in. Her appearance is little more than a cameo so at least she did get out of the movie in time.  Many commenters have resorted to using the daytime conditions during which the movie filming took place as a means to defending its shortcomings. However, CAMP BLOOD was also filmed entirely in daylight and did not even have the benefit of a claustrophobic indoors setting, yet it surpasses SERIAL SLAYER by miles in terms of entertainment value.  Put simply, viewing this movie just once is the very definition of an endurance exercise and most viewers accepting the challenge are going to feel the pain every second.  You have every right to doubt my review of SERIAL SLAYER but if you choose to see it, I think you will find yourself wishing you heeded the warning.  If you want to see a movie with a similar premise, try SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE or SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE.

      " b\"`Bruce Almighty' will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins! It will surpass `Titanic' as the highest grossing film of all time! Jim Carrey's illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers (Carrey included) would possess the powers of God. That very same premise is the paramount ingredient in Carrey's new laugh riot `Bruce Almighty'. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps. God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the `Gift of God'(his powers) in order to challenge him if he can do God's job any better. Obviously, Bruce gets `carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not `mis.pittiful' as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! `Bruce Almighty' is not the most in-depth Carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `Carreyism'! **** Good\"\n",
      " b\"Sweet Helen Hunt is better for bland Andrew McCarthy than sexy-but-bitchy and thoughtless Kelly Preston, but it takes him the entire movie to figure that out. This painfully predictable comedy tries to delay the inevitable by coming up with a series of forced scenes and situations, and it's also visually dreary, despite the potentially majestic locations. I think Hunt is the best thing in the picture. (*1/2)\"\n",

She is just so fantastic that I can watch anything she is in. The same goes for Freeman. he is just magic on the screen.  The two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish.

The short scenario does not waste a word or a frame in this brief interlude in the day of a dysfunctional family. The lives of the father, mother and son are all linked in some way with the gardener. It's this fact that makes the script so intriguing.  For such a short film the production is every bit as professional as any major work and the casting is ideal.  A wonderful little film that can guarantee a few laughs from beginning to end.\"\n",

There\\'s hardly even a plot, which may be a mercy considering what Ed Wood\\'s plots tend to be like.  The whole \"queen of the gorillas\" thing is introduced early in the film, and then just dropped until about seven minutes from the end, as our protagonists head off to Africa to capture some giraffes and rhinos (Howard Hawks so ripped this off for HATARI!) and hunt panthers and tigers.  Yes, tigers. Much of the stock footage they had featured a pair of tigers, so either Adrian Weiss or Ed Wood came up with the notion that a ship carrying a pair of tigers had wrecked on the African coast.  Uh, yeah.'\n",

      " b'Okay; I\\'m not a director; I\\'m not a producer and I may not be a good actor, even, but I could have done everything on this movie better(including sweeping the sets afterwards)!  R.O.T.O.R. seems caught in a cultural time warp; see, it\\'s set in the \"not-too-distant-future\", but was made in 1989, while all the actors look like they\\'re livin\\' like it\\'s 1979 (even feathered hair makes a comeback! AAAGHH!!); and the technological advancements still haven\\'t gone beyond 5 1/4\" floppies.  And speaking of floppy, the story\\'s pretty floppy, too. Seems an android created to fight crime (gee, what an original idea - someone call Paul Verhoeven...) gets dis-combobulated and goes around shooting everyone in sight. Meantime, our hero of the movie hunts him down. Our hero is a real cowboy, pardner, right down to the leather elbow pads on his jacket (does ANYONE wear those anymore? Oh well...).  It looks like the future is mostly made up of malls, small rooms, quaint restaurants, one other police robot that someone must have got as a Heathkit do-it-yourself jobbie and BADLY stop-motion animated R.O.T.O.R.s. But the SOUNDTRACK! Someone\\'s been spending a little too much time around the synthesizer, ya think?  The dialogue, when not delivered with brain-numbing monotonality, is just too stupid for words. Indeed, I was so zonked out by the stupidity of it all, I\\'m lucky my brain hasn\\'t blotted out this experience all together.  It\\'s not just that \"R.O.T.O.R.\" is merely bad, mind you; it\\'s dumb. Dumb in a harmful way. \"Touching the electric fence TWICE\" dumb. \"Sticking your hand down a garbage disposal\" dumb. SO dumb that it\\'s no wonder you\\'ve heard nothing about any of the people involved in it since.   In closing, let me just say that if any of the people who made \"R.O.T.O.R.\" happen to read this, let me ask you: did you clear this with the \"RoboCop\" people before making it?  No stars. Bottom of the barrel is still too high to reach for \"R.O.T.O.R.\"'\n",

Real period stuff, even if it is in the same key, you'll be humming some of the songs for days. What I liked was the nearly all-British cast, with some of the favourite household names.

      " b\"I had some expectation for the movie, since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic.   When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way. Well, the very first scene itself pis*ed me off. Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.  The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies.  Well, the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one.And for that, I give a rating of 2 out of 10.  Guys, please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes.  Thats all.\"\n",
      " b'The best thing about this film is Aaron Webber\\'s portrayal of 13-year-old Emerson. I\\'d recommend keeping an eye on his career in the future.   I found it preposterous that a lad of 13 would desire his teacher. Could someone please explain to me what is appealing about this older man - as far as I can tell, nothing. If the teacher were younger and better looking and the student 16 instead of 13, this movie might be believable. It is hard to get into a movie that is implausible out of the starting gate.  Canadians take pride in their movies because they are often freer and more daring than films made in the U.S.A. But one can be simply sordid and pointless instead of courageous and honest. The film-maker should do something with this greater freedom - not proclaim it for its own sake.  For all its supposed bravery, this movie is surprisingly conventional with regard to its depiction of the human body: The female lead is shown fully and plainly nude, whereas the father and the son are ever so carefully posed to avoid equivalent frankness. How traditionally sexist.  In \"Whole New Thing,\" the viewer is presumably \"liberated\" from hackneyed, conservative American stereotypes. But let\\'s take a closer look at the characters here: In place of sexually crimped, over-zealously religious parents trying to retard the sensuality of their teenage children we get a careworn, pot-smoking couple - a withdrawn, tepid man and his sad, adulterous wife; in place of a restless, dutiful youth shackled by legalistic restrictions on his behavior we get a kid who has no trouble lying about his intentions because he believes the lie will help him manipulate a much older man into having sex with him; and instead of an uninspired teacher limited by narrow, parochial thinking we get a guy who thinks it\\'s perfectly acceptable to cruise for casual sex at a rest stop. Are any of these free-wheeling replacements an improvement over their safer, more traditionally drawn counterparts? Is the indignant radical\\'s cry really, \"Liberate me so I can be sordid and miserable!\"?  There are seeds of a high-quality, courageous film in \"Whole New Thing,\" but they are never watered or cultivated. For example, there is a passably good-looking kid who harasses Emerson verbally and physically at school. At one point, Emerson asks him, \"What is it you want?\" But what if the film-makers with their Canadian courage explored the psychology of the bullying? What if Emerson punched back with gusto, held his own in a fistfight and then asked the question: \"What is it you want?\" What if the bully desired Emerson? (This is certainly more plausible - not to mention more innocent and age appropriate - than Emerson desiring his teacher.) How would such a relationship develop? Would they try to date? Would they meet secretly? How would the relationship affect the other kids in the school? The film might even flash forward to a committed, long-term relationship when the boys are older. Surely this would have been more interesting and daring than the somber radicals we\\'re presented with in this movie.'\n",
      " b\"I don't know, but the movie was just too similar to other movies I've seen. The Ring, The Eye, Dark Water, they're all the same to me. Don't get me wrong, it's beautifully made, lovely camera work, great graphics, but that story is just too.. too common. In the end, it's the score that makes the suspense, you know: the screams, rumbles. The characters in the movie are also not reacting very naturally, moving very slowly, surprised by anything they see. I know some people that love this kind of film, and if you do, being a well made movie, I guess it doesn't hurt to watch it. But if you've seen the movie I've mentioned above and didn't like them, then I'd suggest you don't bother.\"\n",
      " b'This film is a great disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career, some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by Spanish actress Victoria Abril. In JUANA LA LOCA, he relies on a gifted actress as well , newcomer Pilar Lopez de Ayala, but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie. While Lopez de Ayala tries hard to portray Juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband, it seems as if she weren\\'t able to develop her character over this one-dimensional feature; Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and politics of that time were essential in her storyline... but here she\\'s introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera; this is a real pity, and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence History and vice versa. Worst of all, Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri turn out in real bad performances, which, in the case of Liotti is a real problem as he portrays Felipe el Hermoso, a pivotal role in this story. It seems a clear choice to attract young audiences, as both of them look like top-models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors such as Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped. Even if this was a big-budgeted film, little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating \"period pieces\" on the screen. Costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes, as if they were taken from stock material,without regarding of a real coherence. All in all, the main problem with JUANA LA LOCA (and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of a director\\'s point of view. This a strange turn in Aranda\\'s career, as he was able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIAS and AMANTES come to my mind), creating very personal and interesting movies, while this JUANA really is no more than a routine academic historical piece... and a not very good one at that!'\n",
      " b'My wife and I love horror movies and bad ones at that, but this is failure on all levels.  It starts with bad cinematography, as we see the \"happy couple\" looking for the hotel. The whole exchange is shot from behind each actors shoulder. And throughout the couples check and initial dialogue with the neighbor we hardly get a clear shot of the actors faces, except in the hotel mirror.  The first half of the film amounts to a bad retelling on the shining. Jerk of a boyfriend has writers block and becomes a drunk, while the girlfriend supports them both (we see no emotional connection in the actors or reason for us to believe they are even sleeping together, let alone in a relationship). Vaguely odd things happen, a purple coolaid stain on the bed (which we are to believe is blood) comes and goes, the \"writer\" sees ghosts, and we discover the \"writer\" isn\\'t really writing.  At this point the girlfriend gets sick and so does the plot. The bf freaks out and leaves, and the gf, jobless (because she has been sick for so long), is left to face the supposed evil of the room alone. In the only successful jump scene of the move the gf takes a shower only to find a dirty, gray-haired hippy squatting in the shower behind her.  The climatic scene of the film is little more than the ghost of the gf\\'s mother telling her to leave alternated with another ghost telling her to stay and the gf pacing or rolling on the floors.  I feel this film is victim of a singular lack of vision on the part of the writer/director/editor. It seems that a lot of promising elements were here, but they failed to be developed by either the writer, the director, or the editor.'\n",
      " b'I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TV shows.I saw Universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me.Computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name\"The Jetsons\" or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic.Shortly after that till the end...I couldn\\'t believe my eyes!!!!How lucky I was that I could forget all I had seen.Just songs by Tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head.Anyway,I wish to see this space-aged family (also The Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in all graphic computer design as Toy story or Bug\\'s life.The best style for Hanna-Barbera\\'s in my opinion.'\n",
      " b\"It was last night that I got around to seeing this film. I expected something of a martial arts fest and I was right. But what was utterly disappointing was that it was topped off with so much useless garbage that I barely could keep watching. Michael Qissi, though he does and OK job with the stunt choreography, should not direct. He lacks the capability to direct others and the cinematography was totally sick. It is clearly evident that the guy had no proper experience directing a good movie. One thing props up in my mind every time I think about the film, the betrayal. The leads character is betrayed at the beginning of the story, a shot to the heart. However, instead of treating it with certain horror to it, the guy openly touches his wound and rather than show himself the blood, he holds it out for others to see, that too at full arms length. The martial arts are not too shabby but I was disappointed to find out that most of Qissi's martial arts focused on the sheer strength of the fighter. It is a well known fact, since the late Bruce Lee's time, that it does not matter how strong the opponent is, It matters how you quick you react and how fast you can move. Overall, I see that the movie is not for me nor for any fan of the true spirit of martial arts. However, if you want a story that can show you all the violence you want coupled with some extremely bad acting and direction, this should be at the top of your pick.\"\n",
      " b'First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L\\'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the \"sporty type\" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L\\'Engle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine\\'s character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L\\'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest skipping this movie.'\n",
      " b\"August Rush is a modern-themed story about the power of a life force flowing through all of us and how synchronicity, faith and self-assuredness guarantee that each of us can personally fulfill our destiny. Although this film plays well to a broad audience, it is very mystical and based on simple, yet emotional themes that will play flat to some movie-goers.  If you have strong parental feelings or enjoy movies centered on the power of human love and attraction, this story will move you like few films ever have. Great for families- it's completely devoid of explicit scenes that make parents squirm and carries a positive message. Similarly, if you prefer uplifting stories championing the resilience of the human spirit, you'll love it. I gave the film a 10 for that reason- it will remain a personal favorite for years to come. However, if you are easily bored with themes that are lacking in danger and suspense or prefer gritty true-to-life movies, this one may come off as a disappointment.  The screenplay seems written as a spiritual message intimating that there is an energy field that connects all of life, and music is one of the domains available to any who care to experience it.  The plot is simple but deep in implication- an orphaned boy wants to reunite with his parents and feels that his inherited musical genius can somehow guarantee their return. Meanwhile, both parents languish in separation, fate having split them as quickly as it united them in parenthood. Neither know they are parents (see movie for explanation). The film itself was accomplished with imaginative directing and is studded with vivid imagery that punctuates the emotional ebb and flow of the story.   I liked the music, which was richly textured in genre, ranging from classical elements to a folksy modern collection of songs that were tastefully presented by some of the leading cast members. Music is the center-piece of this film, and it works.  I thought the casting was excellent, although none of characters really stood out from the others. Robin Williams plays an antagonistic role, delivering a smashing performance as an orphaned street-wise survivor of enormous depth and understanding, but tragically maligned by a life of rejection. This is a midrange performance by Williams, not the quiet and subdued moodiness of Good Will Hunting, nor the over-animated Morky style. He gives interesting color and charm to a darker figure synchronistically woven into the lives of his fellow cast members. Bravo! Young Freddie Highmore is sharp and charming, though narrow in expression. Just as expected, his natural charisma shines through in a most refreshing manner. Parents Keri Russell and Johnathan Rhys Meyers each lend flawless performances in captivating resonance with the other actors and the film itself. They are interesting and believable. Terrence Howard plays a small but significant part and underacts as well as Kingsly or Gielgud. Excellent! Leon G. Thomas III and Jamia Simone Nash (children) both earn honorable mention. This movie treads on every heartstring. I loved its invitation to believe in the extraordinary miracles of everyday life. Take your kids, your significant other, your parents, or any friend. It is August and will give you a very pleasant Rush. Sit back, breath deep, and get riveted!\"\n",
      " b\"It probably is. I don't know what you cinema fans think, but I think this remake is even better than George Romero's original movie from 1968. When the original Night Of The Living dead came out, it was very scary, and also original... Even though nowadays zombie movies aren't the most original things ever, this one is probably the best one out there.  The story is the same from the 1968 movie. Seven people are trapped in a house, and out there, just zombies, lots of them. It looks like some radioactive disaster has happened, so all the dead are now back to life, and they are looking for food - human brains.  Tom Savini has always done an excellent job by doing make-ups in horror movies, and now he shows himself as a very good director (make-up is another important aspect in zombie movies, and it was done well in this one). The movie isn't very original, and it doesn't have anything that makes it so good, but when you watch it, you'll agree with me... It's a fun movie to watch, and being this way, I consider it the best zombie movie ever made.\"\n",
      " b\"This movie is the spiritual ancestor of so many later boxing film, including the great 'Raging Bull,' but its story is too by-the-numbers for it to be a true classic, in my opinion. It's still an effective movie, however. Similar observations could be made about its star, John Garfield, as well. For a fight film, not that much action takes place inside the ring. This is not inappropriate, since the focus is on Charley Davis' (Garfield) struggles outside the arena, both to win the woman he loves and against the mobster who wants to control him. The last fight sequence, however, is handled particularly well. Director Robert Rossen and cinematographer James Wong Howe can be thanked for that.\"\n",
      " b'Cronenberg\\'s directorial feature film debut is built around a now-familiar amalgamation of sex, technology, and medicine gone mad. The Canadian \"Shivers\" (original American release title \"They Came From Within\", aka \"The Parasite Murders\") opens with a slide show advertising a creepily perfect-sounding high-rise apartment building isolated on an island but just minutes away from downtown Montreal. We are told that the complex contains practically everything necessary to maintain a comfortable life- medical and dental practices, clothing stores, a gift shop, a deli, recreation, etc. Ideally, it would seem, the only reasons a resident would leave would be to work, socialize with non-residents, or take a vacation, if that wasn\\'t too redundant. But of course, something terrible is just under the polished surface.   Cronenberg\\'s direction is obviously not as polished as in later features, but we begin to see his signature style translated well into a full-length format.'\n",
      " b\"I was very skeptical before watching this film. Even if it got John Hurt and Ron Perlman in it, I just couldn't believe the SciFi/Norse legend combination would work. My instinct told me that this was going to be another of those horrible B-movies with a stupid story, sub-average effects and mediocre acting at best. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. Not that it is a masterpiece. The background story could have been a tad bit more elaborate, the plot more original and the final outcome a little bit less predictable, but all in all one has to acknowledge the decent effort to make this movie convincing and suspenseful. The end result is a solid piece of entertainment, with ample effects, directing I'd call 'by the book', workmanlike acting and a few kicks and thrills along the way. So if you happen to like action movies and don't ask for too much depth in the story, this will provide you with a 90 minutes amusement worth the time.\"\n",
      " b\"As an early representation of the turmoil of the 1960's that followed, Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can be excused as an early flower child. The film itself deserves no such latitude. The lack of character development, motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the movie very disappointing. I sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find that Shainberg was letting me peek into a story that must have been someones inside joke. That the few facts presented did not match Diane Arbus' life very much did not help to clarify things either.  The washed out Art Direction in Diane's 'normal' life was nicely contrasted with the brilliant colors in her 'awakening' life with Lionel. And the trap door stairway was a nice demonstration of Diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family (However, I don't see how that trap door in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect to Lionel's apartment which was two flights of stairs up from her's).  Maybe my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond one sentence or one comment. I also would have liked to see at least one of Diane's photos as well. I won't wait for the sequel.\"\n",
      " b'I really enjoyed this film because I have a tremendous interest in American History... the Antebellum years and the Civil War in particular. I purchased it recently from a rack of previously-viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and I was very glad to add this one to my history video collection. Though not of the caliber of Civil War films such as \"Glory\" or \"Gettysburg,\" provides a lot of history on the pre-Civil War brotherhood among cadets at West Point.  Maybe it\\'s the gray uniforms, the youth, or the military discipline, but I am fascinated by the story of the Corps of Cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the War. I imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men, learning how to make war, then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates!  Actually, there were two classes graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. the movie makes no real mention of this, except to mention Henry A. DuPont, first graduate of the May Class; and George Custer, last grad of the June Class. the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war, but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (I think the first class had attended five years, the other for four). As the movie portrays, cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other... George \"Fanny\" or \"Autie\" Custer; Alonzo \"Lon\" Cushing; James \"Beauty\" Stuart (for J.E.B. Stuart, class of 1854), etc.  I say this film is \"Santa Fe Trail\" as it should have been because that 1940 film, while enjoyable, really fudges history. Cadets from several different classes are all graduating together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side-by-side in stopping John Brown\\'s 1859 insurrection at Harper\\'s Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the War. They faced each other (for the first time, I think) at Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was at the Harper\\'s ferry Raid, but Custer was still a cadet at the Point when it took place).  \"Fanny\" Custer plays a role in \"Class of \\'61,\" though his classmate chums, Dev O\\'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictional. I believe they are respectively based on Partick Henry O\\'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can look up.  Anyway, I truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid-19th Century America.'\n",
      " b'Dwight Yoakam must be a hell of a guy. He\\'s personable in interviews, plays and sings his own music with panache, and did a great job of acting in \"Slingblade\". He\\'s such a cool guy that he was able to get a lot of his friends to be in a really bad Western.  I love a good Western. They\\'re especially scarce these days, but this was not one of them. Most people would consider this movie unwatchable, but I stayed with it because I hoped it would get better.  There are a few reasons to see this movie, but not exceptionally strong reasons. One of them was Paul Reuben aka Pee-wee Herman who plays a bad guy named Arvil. That\\'s right - Pee-wee Herman is a bad guy... and he\\'s good at it. I used to make jokes about Pee-wee taking on Chuck Norris in a movie, but after seeing him in this, maybe it\\'s not so far fetched. Reubens does a great job of creating a sadistic, quick tempered little man even with poor direction and writing.  Let\\'s talk about the screenplay a little. Dialogue seems clumsy and sluggish. It\\'s as if the language mired that action in General Store bought molasses. My hunch would be that Billy Bob Thorton wrote his own lines because they\\'re not even on the same planet as the rest of the cast in the movie. Thorton is fun to watch, even if I had a hard time understanding what he was saying. Maybe it because I was focusing on the guy playing his sidekick. I didn\\'t see until the credits Thorton\\'s sidekick was the late great songwriter Warren Zevon.  What there is of a plot is hard to follow. The whole movie is awkward and unfocused. On the plus side, the scenery is nice and most shots are well lit.  \"South of Heaven, West of Hell\" is inaccurately described as a surreal Western. \"El Topo\" is a surreal Western (and much better film). Surreal shouldn\\'t be a synonym for sloppy.'\n",
      " b\"Like a previous poster, I availed of this film in Woolworths in Blackpool while on a trip and pretty flush for cash. I still feel aggrieved. Truly, the worst film I have ever witnessed. The plot is ridiculous, in particular the killing of the prostitute. Why?   It really is an embarrassment to film making. Unbelievably dire. What was Caine thinking? Indeed what was Leslie Grantham thinking. This was his worst decision prior to the web cam episode. The kid is only likable because he is fat and ugly, and you cant help but feel that he's the type to be bullied. The choir aspect is pointless, and I struggle to recall a worse film ever! Well maybe American Dreamz.\"\n",
      " b'My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child. We loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment. This was one such movie, kind of hard to review as I have only seen it the one time as a child, but it is not anything I want to track down again so I can do a more in-depth review. The story has some old horror actor legend dying. I seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top Vincent Price, without being likable and classy. He commits murders and dies, but what is this? Is the movie over already? No, as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave. I remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and I remember this movie was rather disappointing. Seemed to have a good premise, but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire.'\n",
      " b\"Like most comments I saw this film under the name of The Witching which is the reissue title. Apparently Necromancy which is the original is better but I doubt it.  Most scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad. In many ways I think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value! But don't be fooled -there's only 3 scenes with nudity and it's of the people standing around variety. No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!  This movie is so inherently awful it's difficult to know what to criticise first. The dialogue is awful and straight out of the Troma locker. At least Troma is tongue in cheek though. This is straight-faced boredom personified. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora the possessed kid in The Innocents would you believe!) the worst with her high-pitched screechy voice. Welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque. The other female lead has a creepy face so I don't know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the film! And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also looks worringly like Gene Wilder.  It is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy. This is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also dreadful and it's difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up. The 'ghost' mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs.  Really this film (the witching at least) is only for the unwary. It can't have many sane fans as it's pretty unwatchable and I actually found it mind-numbingly dull!   The best bit was when the credits rolled - enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie LIKE THE PLAGUE!\"\n",
      " b'It\\'s been a long time since I have been in the art-house theater and I went to see Douches Froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papers.  The thing is with this movie, is that it has no head or tail, but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters.  When it started I already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. There is no real character development or interconnection between the players. You start in the middle of a situation, all of the sudden there\\'s a girlfriend and then there\\'s a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions, but the way they are put together is quite odd, since they are \"just put together\", so it seems.  And all of the sudden they have sex with each other, at least one you can see of. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all I could think of during the movie was \"when are they gonna have sex again?\". And when you think of it, it\\'s quite insane really. Because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at, but three teens going at it and that, for me at least, makes it a very crappy movie, stay clear from it and save your money (my \\xc2\\x807,50 is wasted), there are better art-house movies than this one.  I give three stars for the acting performance, one each.'\n",
      " b'Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks on so many levels it\\'s pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low budget retread makes me yawn.  Jon Bon Jovi (the poor man\\'s Kevin Bacon) drives around Mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala Antonio Banderas\\'s guitar case in DESPERADO. He picks up some lame \"hunters\" along the way (including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire), and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest (to walk in the sunlight by stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so). If you\\'ve seen the first VAMPIRES, you\\'ve already seen this, and done much better.  John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. Frankly, I think he\\'s past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic. The only decent film he\\'s done since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is complete crap, right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are more greats like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING?  Carpenter crony Wallace proves he can\\'t write his way out of a paper bag with his paper-thin script packed with yawns, groans and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention I hated every character in the movie? There was not a single memorable character in the whole film. How does that happen? This film has nothing to recommend it. Not even the DVD presentation is good; the menu looks awful.  By comparison, JASON X: \"FRIDAY THE 13th IN SPACE\" was a masterpiece. Now that is how you make a sequel and (re)energize a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an exciting DVD menu.'\n",

But you\\'re getting paid and possibly getting your SAG card, so who cares. At least it\\'s a production that lacks any pretense of prestige, so you didn\\'t have to sleep with the director.

      " b\"Chop Shop, the second feature from Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story not usually found in American cinema, the story of the of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Shot on location in Queens, New York in the shadows of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is neo-realism to the core. Featuring a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic Bicycle Thieves than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diagetic. Watching it feels like watching a great foreign film, it takes us to another world because it is so uncommon to see. However this other world is not post-World War II Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi, it is contemporary New York City.  Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. He is a 12-year-old Latin-American kid with no parents or family unit to watch after him. He lives in a tiny room upstairs in the auto shop that he also works at. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). Neither of them have made it passed second grade. Ale, though young, is tough and mature. He acts as the head of the small family. He hooks his sister up with a job, and he himself does anything he can to make a buck when not working at the chop shop. He sells bootleg DVDs on the streets and candy in subways. He searches for scrap auto parts and sells them to the many auto shops lining the street where he lives.  Alejandro is heartbroken when he learns his sister is working nights as a prostitute. He himself becomes progressively disinterested in abiding by the law. He begins to steal, first car parts and later wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist in Bicycle Thieves, we cannot blame Ale for becoming a thief. It is merely survival. Ale and Isamar save up in hopes of buying a food vending van for $4,500. They see the van as their way out, and there is much optimism. However, as is usually the case in neo-realism, we know this will only lead to disappointment.  Polanco's riveting performance is what gives legitimacy to Chop Shop's realism. Here is a 12-year-old character that needs to be believably independent and vulnerably naive. Whether he is directing cars to the shop, selling movies and Snickers bars or playing with his sister in their scanty room, it is authentic.  Chop Shop is a sobering reminder that not all American children grow up in a land of opportunity. Ale's lifestyle is what many in middle-class white America consider 'third world'. They act cognizant the poverty and deprivation in foreign lands while sipping their coffee and reading the New York Times on Sunday morning, but make themselves blind to it on their own streets. Once you watch Chop Shop, you will think differently of the kids peddling candy on the subway.  more reviews at www.mediasickness.com\"\n",
      " b'Set in the Cameroons in West Africa in the 1950s, Claire Denis\\' Chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of French rule. The theme is similar to the recent Nowhere in Africa, though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis. The film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country. France Dalens (Mireille Perrier), a young woman traveling through Cameroon, recalls her childhood when her father (Francois Cluzet) was a government official in the French Cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant, Prot\\xc3\\xa9e (Isaach de Bankol\\xc3\\xa9). The heart of the film, however, revolves around France\\'s mother Aim\\xc3\\xa9e (Giulia Boschi) and her love/hate relationship with Prot\\xc3\\xa9e that is seething with unspoken sexual tension.   The household is divided into public and private spaces. The white families rooms are private and off limits to all except Prot\\xc3\\xa9e who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors, exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family\\'s gazes. It becomes clear when her husband Marc (Fran\\xc3\\xa7ois Cluzet) goes away on business that Aim\\xc3\\xa9e and Prot\\xc3\\xa9e are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged. In one telling sequence, she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other\\'s image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes, knowing that any interaction is taboo.   The young France (Cecile Ducasse) also forms a bond with the manservant, feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky. In spite of their bond, the true nature of their master-servant relationship is apparent when France commands Prot\\xc3\\xa9e to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home, and when Prot\\xc3\\xa9e stands beside her at the dinner table, waiting for her next command. When a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains, the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located. Each visitor shows their disdain for the Africans, one, a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room. Another, Luc (Jean-Claude Adelin), an arrogant white Frenchman, upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower, eats with the servants, and taunts Aim\\xc3\\xa9e about her attraction to Prot\\xc3\\xa9e leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservant.  Chocolat is loosely autobiographical, adapted from the childhood memories of the director, and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed. Denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters. There are no victims or oppressors, no simplistic good guys. Prot\\xc3\\xa9e is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where Aim\\xc3\\xa9e and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena. It is a sad fact that Prot\\xc3\\xa9e is treated as a boy and not as a man, but Bankol\\xc3\\xa9 imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain. Because of its pace, Western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and Denis does not, in Roger Ebert\\'s phrase, \"coach our emotions\". The truth of Chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart.'\n",
      " b\"This may have been made for the hell of it, but it was most probably the worst film i've seen in years, The best thing about the entire DVD would be the case!!! I'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too, I'm glad i only rented. I suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and Gothic to care about it without taking in any CGI or any other effects for that matter, I hope Alex Chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better film in the future, that is, if he is still in work.

      " b'Decoys isn\\'t fine art by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a modern edition of classic \"B\" horror movies. There\\'s the requisite tentacled monsters, scantily-clad (a light bit of nudity toward the beginning of the movie) sorority girls, and a hidden killer decimating the campus population...the difference in this case being that all three are the same girls. Overall, it was fun, light on the \"science\" part of the science fiction, and even the dialogue wasn\\'t painfully corny. The plot was put together fairly consistently, and the acting was good for, admittedly, relative unknowns. The special effects were good quality for a relatively small film (*I* didn\\'t see this advertised at theaters), with excellently-rendered, snappy tentacles. The creatures themselves (the women in alien form) moved a bit oddly/unrealistically, but that\\'s something that big-budget movies still have problems with, from time to time. I liked the mechanism of the aliens\\' attack and the fact that their lack of belly buttons was a dead giveaway to their true natures. Ultimately, it\\'s not Shakespeare in the Park, but it was a heck of a lot of fun to watch. I\\'m looking forward to the sequel, myself.'\n",

      " b\"No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model in the 'Mona Lisa', posed her in a different way, and painted her you could only compare the framing,concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally.  That said this film doesn't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly, like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work.  The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It's nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it's that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent, Norman didn't really understand sex, he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful Marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn't really understand sex and his attraction to her,this makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are on his side because he doesn't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his 'Mother'. In the remake that whole dynamic is gone, I must admit to Janet Leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that, Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman finding 'her' Marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a Norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like, who you feel absolutely no sympathy for, they further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room. It destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for, it's like re-making 'It's a wonderful life' and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading.  The only other character that I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's workmate. In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line 'he must have noticed my wedding ring' it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself, when Rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn't any other reason why any man would flirt with Anne Heche over her.  I'll admit that I am very biased, the original 'Psycho' is my favorite film of all time, had the film been a reworking, with a different angle, then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable.  Hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de-sensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour. (n.b before people think 'he can't spell' remember I'm from England and we spell it colour)  A remake should be just that, re made, this is a forgery, a complete copy and a very bad one at that. I could go on comparing but there is no point, almost everything is superior in the original. The only one thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him 'The Stiff' behind his back) and Mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals.  Overall a movie that should be labeled 'Expensive Embarrassing Failed Experiment. Only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you. But view original too' The movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a reworking but as it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)\"\n",
      " b\"this film, at least as far as the DVD jacket is concerned, is portrayed as an action movie about the changes that take place in soldiers seeing combat. Until the battle scene is over and you realize that the focus is instead going to be on their post-combat return to civilian life, you are expecting something unique and insightful. This movie is so clich\\xc3\\xa9' ridden as to be laughable, from the conceit of a short-timer squad going out on one last patrol (yeah, yeah, the same as every 19 year on-the-job cop movie where the sergeant dies the day before retirement, yawn), to the PTSD laden troubles that have been shown over and over in so many movies, so much better, in the past 30 years. I'm truly embarrassed for Samuel Jackson. I would have thought he would have had much better sense in selecting a script. He does great. Can he not? But THIS film? I'm 3/4 the way through and still waiting for just a hint of something original that I have not seen before (employment woes, civilian misconceptions, drug and alcohol abuse, slams against the VA -yawn). And don't get me started on offering a role to an overpaid gangster like fiddy cent to try and lure viewers instead of spending the money on talented writers. Man, this is the first time in my life I have been so incensed at such a misrepresentation of an unoriginal film. I will ask for my money back.\"\n",
      " b\"Throughout the 1970's Denmark had only one TV Channel. We had Rockford, Kojak, Columbo, and McCloud, but no Frank Cannon. Those of us who could watch West German TV, though, had a chance to enjoy the Frank Cannon series, if we could live with the fact that he spoke German. German TV dubbed (and still do)very much anything foreign into German. It was also the time before a VCR would be found in every home. Had it not been for that, I would probably had ignored the language barrier and recorded the shows for keeps. I just loved to watch him cruise around in the Lincoln Mark IV and solve crimes. Is there anyone who can help me with tapes with this series? Kind regards Mogens\"\n",
      " b'Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties, Eugene Pallette as the gruff police detective, Jack La Rue as the \"swarthy\" Italian and of course, James Lee as \"The Chinese Cook\", this film is THE great mystery of a murder in a locked room. For an early 1930\\'s film, this step by step \"peeling of the veneer of the mystery\" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except in this film, you don\\'t have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance.'\n",
      " b\"I always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime-time every year in the 60's. It's a typical Hollywood history epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what, it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn who had the supporting role of Beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again. DeMille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 Commandments to help Quinn pull it off including longtime DeMille associate producer/actor Henry Wilcoxon overseeing the project. Also from the 10 Commandments are screenwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, 2nd unit director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, set directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester who as a costume design team received The Buccaneer's only Oscar nomination. A great cast here from team DeMille headed up by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future President General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. At just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.\"\n",
      " b\"I have no idea why some of the reviews I've seen on both IMDb and netflix are positive to this movie. Perhaps it is because friends of the filmmaker wrote in. Because I can only use 1,000 words to denigrate this film, I will try to be curt: First, for this film to be effective on any level (comedy, social satire, politically, whatever) it would have to have some basis in truth. In other words, the filmmaker should have interviewed historians, sociologists, and other intellectuals who could have drawn some reasonable projection on what modern day America would have looked like had the south won the war.  The fact that the filmmaker concluded that there would have been one country was so ludicrous, he lost all credibility.  Therefore, the mock commercials that ran through this movie were not only unfunny - but totally stupid given that no reality had been adequately established in this movie.  The various vignettes (lincoln being a black-faced escapee) were dull, stupid, reaching and clearly designed for the filmmakers hopes of becoming a staff writer on SNL or Mad TV.  Spike Lee is a very talented filmmaker and should not be faulted for producing this movie. He probably had little involvement and was busy shooting his Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster film INSIDE MAN - a movie TOTALLY worth watching.  But this is simply tripe. Beware good reviews. They're probably friends of the filmmaker. This movie was not funny in the least, had no real insight to what ACTUALLY would have happened if the south won the war, and is a totally gigantic WHO CARES??????\"\n",

The survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island, a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own. after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting? and heres your answer, every season SO FAR has always been full of surprises, your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what\\'s gonna happen next each time, very unexpected thing\\'s happen and the story goes on wonderfully SO FAR! The series just sucks you in, it\\'s chilling and very addictive, everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story. Lost is simply unbelievable, amazing, highly entertaining, top notch, t.v at it\\'s best.How ever you want to put it.   Lost beat\\'s all other show\\'s by a landslide. And if your hating or criticising Lost you don\\'t know how to watch t.v or watch drama. Lost simply doesn\\'t disappoint, you would think a series carrying on for so long can\\'t keep getting better. But it does! It just keep\\'s on flowing it\\'s unlike anything you would ever think off. \"Every thing happens for a reason.\" And that is truly shown in the series. Eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that\\'s happened or being done adds up. You will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on.   The 10 minutes of excitement: You see something you didn\\'t see coming, something major has happened to character or on the island. There\\'s hope somewhere. You see a major twist that can or will change everything. You hear your thought\\'s churn, you wonder what\\'s gonna happen next. Your heart beating. The 30 minutes of brilliance: You see a flawless scenes, tension building, you hear wonderful music by Michael Giacchino. You see great flash backs, impressive acting. You see wittiness, chilling atmosphere, which then get\\'s converted back into tension.  Everyone has there show that they are addicted too, that they can\\'t get enough of, that they admire every minute and can\\'t wait for the next episode, That they talk about 24/7. Too me and many others it\\'s this series. Lost. Once you start watching, you won\\'t get enough. The creators did a flawless job. Lost is completely unique and original, you won\\'t see anything like it. The clever idea of \"flashbacks and flashforwards\" and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts. Would they ever make a series like \"LOST\"? Something so interesting and something you will always remember. It simply has stunned the world when it hit t.v. A new generation of dramatic/sci-fi. A instant classic before it reached out to the viewers.  I\\'m sure you all heard of lost and it\\'s 5 star reviews, and your annoying friend that won\\'t stop telling you about it, so what\\'s stopping you from watching?  Every episode leads to something new and it just doesn\\'t stop getting better and better, you get more interested as it goes along, you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn\\'t even think off. The characters start to become very likable, and if your the critic type you would love to see Lost in further detail, things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the Island. All together it\\'s a great drama and a flawless series. I guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far.....so if you don\\'t watch lost, read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind. Seeing is believing, so until you start watching you will never know .I strongly recommend this masterpiece of series: LOST!! start watching!!! You have not seen nothing until you watch LOST!!!'\n",
      " b\"Growing up as of child of the movies, one of the trilogies I shall not soon forget is that of the Karate Kid. You can put down Ralph / Daniel all you want, but its the message behind the movies that are important, that its important to be respectful to all creatures great and small, but stand up for yourself when the time calls for it. Getting back to the movie at hand, its rather funny because, I saw Boys Don't Cry and was really impressed with the performance of Hillary Swank, and in flipping through the sea of channels the other night, I came across the showing of this film and I hadn't realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it. The story centers around Julie, just like Daniel, not knowing where to fit in or if she even wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help straighten her out and guide her. I really liked this addition to the series as it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes, even some outfits that Hillary were in kept me, shall we say stimulated.  Overall 3.5 out of 5\"\n",
      " b\"As unpopular as this comment will be, this film is a total sham. It's so one sided and false that it would be funny if so many people didn't buy into it. John Lennon was a fascist who supported the communist Russian, Chinese and North Vietnamese governments through personal and band proceeds from their shows. His support of the guerrilla movement of the vicious Black Panther's is covered but oddly enough it is glorified. Let's remember that the Black Panther's were one of the largest violent anti American groups during that time period. They shot, stabbed and beat people for disagreeing with their views and bombed businesses and government buildings. No surprises here, this is to be expected out of Hollywood. I just wish that more of our young people had the benefit of the truth of historic record instead of relying on these kinds of factual inaccuracies to guide their thought process.\"\n",
      " b'This film has great intentions but fails in areas too major to ignore: acting and script. When I saw it at a film festival, the audience repeatedly laughed at the corny lines (\"I can\\'t believe I just witnessed that.\") and overwrought, one-dimensional acting. The director apparently told his cast to look menacing, and oh, did they look menacing. The actress who played James\\' girlfriend was so awful that I felt embarrassed for her. Some of the \"horror\" elements were amateurish and silly, again eliciting uncomfortable giggles. The cinematography is beautiful but often not in sync with the theme (such as a character gliding through golden cornfields). Too bad, because the basic story is fascinating.'\n",
      " b'Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn\\'t convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line \"I\\'m Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life....\" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst.   The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn\\'t kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer.  DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy, despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money\\'s been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy, and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he\\'d been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve\\'s gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record (on a State Police computer no less!) without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable - even children know data can be restored, and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me, the film became a joke and I couldn\\'t wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies, the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again, Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting, no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting, a rushed and unfulfilling ending, far too much gore, not enough character substance, one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence.'\n",
      " b\"This film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue that the book offers. The main point of the book, the insights, are hardly even touched upon, leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is making such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives.  The character development is not good at all. No background or personal development leaves the audience not really caring at all about what happens to them, and so the action sequences fall flat.  The search for the manuscripts ends abruptly, and with no real explanation, not leaving any sense of satisfaction as to what the whole search was for.  This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I have ever seen. It is horrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you have read the book, skip the movie and reread it.  It is almost as if the point of making the movie was to discredit the book, that is how poorly done and ridiculous this movie is. It is a shame too, because it could have been good had they capitalized on it at the height of its success and they probably would have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors.  Please don't waste your time, READ THE BOOK!!!\"\n",
      " b\"If you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so, then it's OK to watch this. It's not all that bad, really. Yeah, it's got more lapses in logic than I care to describe here and might tax the patience of people - like myself, I have to admit - who are inclined to throw things at the TV on occasion, but it's funny at least. Just because it's not always INTENTIONALLY funny, there's no need to let that get you down.  However, if you've read the book - or any of the other books by Brookmyre - then you'd probably best avoid it. I've read them all and when I first watched this film, I despised it. I've trashed it in detail and at great length on another site, in fact. The TV plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful (and admittedly rabid) Brookmyre fans.  Best bit of advice..? Watch this, then read the book and only THEN make your comparisons and submit your judgement.\"\n",
      " b\"This has got to be the fastest I have ever jumped at seeing a movie before. A porno puppet movie. Jeez, do I need help or what. Speaking of my mental state, I'd just like to say Let My Puppets Come was surprisingly good and made this little brain of mine pretty dang happy. The story revolves around group of businessmen who have failed in their latest business venture. Mr. Big, played by Rufus in Bloodsucking Freaks, backed their previous venture and he now wants his money back or else. Well, the guys hatch a plan to get his money back and make a little of their own. They decide to make a stag film. A skin flick. A porno movie! And that's just what they do. They even make some X-rated commercials to put in the movie as well. My fav being the one for women's hygiene, called Sweet Fish. Well, the movie is a nice lil treat for fans of the bizarre, fans of porn and definitely fans of Meet The Feebles. It's got bestiality and some nice puppet bj's. Can't go wrong with puppet bj's now can ya? No siree Bob. So if you're in the mood to check out something really goofy and unique give Let My Puppets Come a chance. 6.5 outta 10\"\n",
      " b'I gave this film 3 out of 10 - one star for the three attractive male leads. What does that tell you about it\\'s appeal? The story was, to put it mildly, odd. There were moments in the film that made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The writing was awful. Half way through it felt like the writer was trying to devise a new lingo in hopes of having it catch on. I don\\'t know, maybe there are people out there that talk that way, but I certainly haven\\'t run into any. I would advise avoidance of this film at all costs, even if your tempted to check it out just for the pretty packaging. Trust me, it\\'s not worth the rental. Go rent \"The Broken Hearts Club\".'\n",
      " b'Why this is called \"Mistresses\" is a puzzle, because it\\'s about four women, three of whom aren\\'t mistresses\\xc2\\x85 Except, wait. Ah, I see. It\\'s a salacious title and we all have to merchandise I suppose. The series itself? Delicious. Most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves. Great fun. Reminds me of LWT\\'s 1976 miniseries \"Bouquet of Barbed Wire\", where every character and their dads wielded the machete.  Siobhan (Orla Brady) is the only actual mistress and she\\'s getting herself in proper trouble. Husband is infertile. So no chance of a baby there then. But at work, there\\'s Dominic, played by uber-sexy Adam Rayner, who looks so good that there\\'s no surprise when heavy lust breaks out. Dominic, it turns out, has no fertility problems. I expect his sperms do swashbuckling - probably each carries a little sword - and now Siobhan is inevitably pregnant that way instead. What Siobhan should do is to shut up good and tight, and go with - it\\'s a miracle. What she actually does of course is say to her friends \"I have to tell my husband\". No you don\\'t. Really, you don\\'t. Stop. Stop!  Katie (Sarah Parish) was a mistress once, for we learn that she\\'d had an affair with a married man before the series started. Unwisely, she\\'s now taken up with his son. The father died of cancer and Katie, who is a doctor, helped him on his journey. So, she\\'s an euthanasiarist, has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in carelessly ignoring the incestuous undertones. It\\'s not going to end well for Katie.  Jessica is an experimental lesbian. She arranges events and she\\'s busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets underway. She quickly gets into steamy eye exchanges with one of the brides Alex, played by Anna Torv, and the script hurries along to a lesbonk with great haste. However, it can\\'t think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together, so it invents a very lame \"You\\'re not having a hen night?! Well I can\\'t let you get away with that. I\\'ll organise one and the guests shall be .. Me!\", which achieves the result but isn\\'t exactly Winterson. I thought script writers were supposed to earn their living. Lazy. Torv\\'s interpretation of her character is good. Alex treats Jessica as possibly unsavoury and Alex\\'s body language always points backwards when she\\'s moving forward. Mind, once she\\'s over the wall, in she happily goes, and unsurprisingly, for Shelley Conn is so mouth-watering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chance.  Which brings us to Trudi, who\\'s a widow. Of course there should be plain people in a community but, if you\\'re going to have a plain character, then you have to invent something to admire in them. It\\'s quite possible to be a lump and engaging. However, Small\\'s Trudi looks like one of those characters that Casting put prominently in a medieval crowd scene after the director said \"That\\'s ridiculous, not every single character would be pretty\". More tellingly, you can\\'t find anything to admire in her. Nothing. She\\'s a turnip in a bowl of apples. Appallingly, she does \"sexy\" from time to time. I won\\'t forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time, and for all the wrong reasons.  So, good, delinquent fun all round. There\\'s easily enough material here for a second series and I hope that they do one. I trust they learn one lesson though. The characters never take off their underclothes in bed! Having spent abandoned hours of unbridled lust, afterwards they surface still wearing their bras, or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits. After several episodes, no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock. What\\'s this? Early 21st century puritanism? So production team, are you listening? Your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they Do abandon as well as Talk it. At least they\\'ll have more fun in the fun scenes, poor things. In a series dominated by either being in the bedroom, or wanted to be in the bedroom, or having just been in the bedroom, it\\'s a bit silly, and jars a lot, that the characters bonk in their underwear.  Overall. I was going to score 6 (top end medium), but the series does one trick that\\'s rare enough. When each episode ends, you always want more, and you look forward to the next one with anticipation. So I score 7.'\n",

First of all, Sean Penn\\'s performance is awesome! He really look a mentally challenged person in all his acts and ways to move and talk! Michelle Pfeiffer also has a great performance and is very beautiful in this movie as Sam\\'s lawyer Rita Harrison.  Sam Dawson is a mentally retarded man, who has the same capacity of a 7 year-old child..He works at a Starbucks, loves the Beatles( his favorite band) and one day has a normal daughter with a homeless woman, who abandons him and her daughter when she has the chance. Sam takes care of his daughter, who he gives the name Lucy Diamond, with the help of his friends, specially Annie.( a piano teacher who is his neighbour) But time is passing, and when Lucy reaches 7 years old she understands her father is not *normal* and intentionally tries not to be smarter than him,what makes her have problems in school. The Social service takes her away to another family, and Sam needs the help of a lawyer to win the case. That\\'s where Rita Harrison enters, and she will not only help Sam, but learn great values with him.  aka \"Uma Li\\xc3\\xa7\\xc3\\xa3o de Amor\" - Brazil'\n",
      " b'This film is set in my hometown of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, home of the London Bridge. What I can tell you about this film is that you should only see it if you live in LHC and would like a big laugh. To see big stars (Rose Marie from the Dick Van Dyke Show and David Hasselhoff) in our little meccha is unreal, especially when you see that Rose Marie is the owner of the hotel at the edge of town. This film is one for the history books, and if you had the opportunity to see this film on NBC when it first aired, you would have probably seen the Apple Computer \"1984\" commercials a few times too. Ahh memories!'\n",
      " b'This program was quite interesting. The way the program was displayed made it all the more interesting. String Theory is also very interesting to listen too. The whole three hours in my opinion were well worth it. I enjoyed listening to the ideas given by the physicists. Extra dimensions really boggle the mind. If you have the chance, watch this amazing documentary.'\n",
      " b'The trouble I have watching this movie today is - \"Where did the last thirty six years go?\" I was on my way to the original \"Peace and Arts Festival\" before the crush of traffic on Sullivan County\\'s portion of Route 17 and my own youthful practicality decided against it. For a brief hour or so I abandoned my car on the side of the road to make the trek to a then unknown location, but it seemed odd to me that as many people were coming from the direction of Yasgur\\'s Farm as going toward it. With estimates of how much further ranged from a couple of miles to as much as twenty, I reversed course, and by the time I got halfway home, the skies opened up in buckets of rain.  In another odd bit of serendipity, when the film came out I was going to college in Buffalo, New York, and wound up heading to Toronto with a buddy for a day trip. While there, we couldn\\'t pass up the theater marquis promoting \"Woodstock\", and saw it on \\'foreign\\' soil so to speak. Like it was yesterday. The film\\'s odd legacy would continue, shortly after I saw Wavy Gravy in person at a university drug symposium - \"What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand!\"  I\\'m sure everyone has their favorite acts from the Woodstock bill. The 25th Anniversary DVD managed to tack on a memorable Janis Joplin performance, along with the electrifying \\'Voodoo Child\\' number from Jimi Hendrix. The spirit of the entire three day adventure seemed to be epitomized by Joe Cocker\\'s stirring \\'With a Little Help From My Friends\\', that along with the unlikely appearance of a trio of nuns walking through the pasture, one of them flashing a peace sign.  It was a bit surreal back then, and even now to realize that a city of almost half a million people came together for a weekend, enjoyed three days of peace and music, and then disbanded quietly while a nation watched in wonder. Nothing quite like it has ever been attempted since, and it may be the moon and stars may never line up quite the same way again.  For those who live nearby the original Woodstock site in Bethel, there are subtle present day reminders of past glory, like the colorful \\'Yasgur Farms\\' dairy trucks making local deliveries. A more auspicious presence is the newly opened \\'Bethel Woods Center For The Arts\\' that had it\\'s grand opening in 2005. One of the debut performances during the inaugural season featured a return visit of Woodstock alumni, Crosby, Stills and Nash, this time with fellow musician Neil Young. You can learn more about the center at http://www.bethelwoods.us/  Reminiscing about the heady days of 1969 and Woodstock, a lot of nostalgic thoughts come to mind. Janis, Jimi, Jerry Garcia and Max Yasgur have passed on, while bands like The Who and CSNY are still capturing the magic for legions of (aging) fans. Seeing the movie after all these years inspires me to alter slightly that old adage about lemons; in the playful spirit of the hippie generation, \\'If life hands you mud, make mudslides\\'!'\n",
      " b\"As a cinema fan White Noise was an utter disappointment, as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good, nicely lit, good camera work, reasonable direction. But as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other 'so called' horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with. Although it did have a little bit of the 'chill factor' the whole concept of the E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did'not seem believable. This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them. The acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion, like many recent thriller/horror movies.  Definitely not a movie I will be buying on DVD and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it.\"\n",
      " b\"One of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was turning this one down. Julianne Moore was as emotionless throughout as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars??? Give me a break! Rumor has it that he didn't want his name even mentioned in the credits. And frying and feeding his own brain to Ray Liotta...I was laughing at the absurdity, no make that stupidity of this flick at this point. I haven't seen so many people walk out of a movie since Who's That Girl.  Pay someone else to go for you if you must, but miss this one AT ALL COST!!!\"\n",
      " b\"Fame is one of the best movies I've seen about The Performing Arts. The music and the acting are excellent. The screenplay and Set Design are also excellent. My favorite part is when all the students start Dancing and making music in the Canteen. I can see this movie any number of times, and never get bored. I give it 8 1/2 on 10.\"\n",
      " b'This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of \"Hamlet\" to ever reach the screen. Branagh\\'s approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket, having Fortinbras\\' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\") when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco (who shouts the very un-Shakespearean cry of \"ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack\" before being gunned down), and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney\\'s Bottom and Mary Pickford\\'s Kate.  Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia\\'s relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.  The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of Kenneth Branagh. This is never so apparent as in the \"How All Occasions Inform Against Me\" speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film (at least that\\'s how it feels), which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind\\'s \"I\\'ll never be hungry again.\" This may serve Branagh\\'s ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech: when I saw the film in the theater, I leaned over to my companion and snickered \"Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet.\" Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to out-do the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword. Branagh\\'s Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius\\' heart with a super hero\\'s bulls eye. The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny.  While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man\\'s ego out of control.'\n",
      " b'Along with Ken Russell, John Boorman can be seen as a key figure in the modern British cinema... His interest in myth, dream, landscape and memory may be compared with that of Resnais, Leone, and Roeg...  Boorman\\'s \\'Excalibur\\' is characterized by his use of jealousy and adultery, sex and sorcery... It is also characterized by fire and fog, shadow and moonlight, creating an air of mystery that is essential element in the Arthurian legend...  Boorman\\'s \\'Excalibur\\' is a mythical presentation leading the viewers to travel with the flow of the legend... It is a magical story with wonderful exotic sets, and interesting camera-work in the lush green scenery of Ireland... (The Cinematography won an Academy Award Nomination).  Boorman\\'s \"Excalibur\" is both fantasy and philosophy... Love seems to be a destructive force, lyrically beautiful and bravely realistic...  The film brings to life the fateful story of a solitary hero, his ascension to the throne, the love triangle of Camelot, the quest for the Holy Grail, the decline and eventual fall of Arthur and Camelot... Along for the ride are his indispensable Knights of the Round Table, particularly Sir Lancelot...  The characters in Boorman\\'s \"Excalibur\" are extremely well developed... Arthur is seen as a naive squire, who develops into an idealistic king... Arthur tries to use Might for the establishment of Right, and according to his own laws, he puts reason over love...  A prominent figure in the film is Merlin... He lives backwards, which makes him \"a dream to some, a nightmare to others.\" He defines the cave of the dragon as a place where all things meet their opposite: \"The future and the past, desire and regret, knowledge and oblivion\". But when Morgana pronounces \"love\", one would expect Merlin to answer \"hate\", but he just says: \"O yes.\"  Morgana knows that Uther and Merlin are responsible for the death of her father... She dedicates her life to revenge.. Her scenes with Merlin are full of fire and poison... When she steals the \"charm of making\" from Merlin, Morgana gets stronger... We feared her lines when she affirmed: \"I can ease your loneliness.\"  Lancelot looks at himself as a sinful person who has betrayed a friend... He stays lonely in the forest, haunted by sorrow and pain... He dreams of a fight with himself... And when he wakes up naked, he sees his own sword stuck in his side... The film endures and inspires because it embodies mankind\\'s deepest yearnings...  Among the many elements that make the movie work is the cast: Nigel Terry, the rightful King who, accidentally, removes the sword of power easily, not once, but twice; Helen Mirren, the enchantress Morgana, Merlin\\'s nemesis and Arthur\\'s treacherous half-sister, who seduces Merlin, and then encircles him in a stream of vengeance; Nicholas Clay, persuasively ardent and athletic as the First Knight; Cherie Lunghi, the damsel in distress who loves her husband with her mind and Lancelot with her heart; Nicol Williamson, the wily Merlin who would see that the young Arthur receive the necessary training and guidance to fulfill his unlikely destiny; Gabriel Byrne, the hot-blooded Uther Pendragon, who plunges \\'Excalibur\\' deep into a stone rock in one last act of defiance; Katrine Boorman, the woman taken as by a fully armored King; Liam Neeson, the knight who dares to accuse the Queen; and Robert Addie, the \\'unholy child\\' who comes to Camelot to demand the throne of his father...  One of the more fascinating aspects of the film (and there are many...) are the differences between Uther and Arthur... King Uther is unable to master his instincts... His world is confusion, disorder, and unlimited passion... The characteristic developments of Arthur occur as he faces the trials of his life... The knowledge of the affair yet his love for his beautiful wife and best friend wage war inside of his mind... When he sees Guinevere in the arms of Lancelot, he stuck \\'Excalibur\\' between them loosing his connection to the extraordinary powers of Merlin and the Lady of the Lake...  John Boorman\\'s films frequently concern contradictions and polarities, tensions between nature and civilization, dream and reality... Equally, his career as a whole swings violently between success and failure, intelligent ambition and pretentiousness...'\n",
      " b'\"Sky Captain\" may be considered an homage to comic books, pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres. One contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences. I don\\'t think this is at all true. One\\'s expectations of the films,fiction and serials that \"Captain\" pays tribute to were entirely different. Especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children. This film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those. Of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama. Toward the climax of \"Captain\" Law and Paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal. They take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy. Of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency.  One doesn\\'t expect films like this to necessarily \"make sense\". One does expect them to be fun, thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic. \"Captain\" has almost none. Remember when Law and Paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge? Well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side? They can FLY!!! The chasm itself means nothing to them. The bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape? If the land across the chasm is \\'forbidden\\' to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if.  I know that Paltrow and Law (both of whom have given fine performances in the past) were playing \"types\" but both were pretty flat. Only Giovanni Ribisi (who showed himself capable of great nuance here) and Angelina Jolie seemed to give any \"oomph\" to their roles although Omid Djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he\\'d only been given the chance. He did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted.  The film had a great \\'look\\' but there are so many ways in which CGI distracts. CGI works best when it is used for the fantastical, when it is used to create creatures who don\\'t exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular. When it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints. There is no real sense of wonder. A CGI mountain doesn\\'t have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does. I know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn\\'t necessarily supposed to LOOK real but shouldn\\'t it FEEL that way? It just didn\\'t.   As for the weak and clich\\xc3\\xa9d script...homage is no excuse. Even so, had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable. \"The Last Samurai\" was as predictable as the days of the week and I am no fan of Tom Cruise but it had everything that \"Captain\" didn\\'t most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that \"Sky Captain\" most definitely did not.  I\\'d like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30\\'s and 40\\'s. The original (Jay Garrick) Flash or Green Lantern (Alan Scott) come to mind as being ripe for such treatment. Maybe the better, more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film. It would be hard to be worse.'\n",
      " b\"This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen. It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps. The movie starts out bad (I would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1/10) and then it get progressively worse, minute by minute. The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety, long minutes. Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video. Somehow the video manages even to make cute, scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful. This movie is amazingly bad. I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over and with Buscemi's character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in your ear than to watch this movie. The sequels are not nearly as bad. If you have to rent a Troma film, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I would rather watch 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than to see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again. Don't get me wrong, it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful, this is it.\"\n",
      " b\"I will say that when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was impressed. The idea of the stepmother getting a hold of the wand and turning back time is pretty neat! I've not seen the second movie, nor do I plan to.  The animation for this film is decent, though sometimes Cinderella looks like a man and her head is too big. The jokes are cheesy and the majority of the plot is see-through, but what can I do? I'm an adult and may have lost some of my child-like innocence. The music is unmemorable...sort of.  Good film for children as a sequel but is much too reminiscent of The Little Mermaid in places and other Disney films to be unique. Watch if you're intrigued by the plot setup but don't bother buying this one unless it's for your kids.\"\n",
      " b'Honestly, this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies I have ever seen. Partly, because it takes itself so seriously, as opposed to regular light hearted trash, this movies wants you to be emotionally involved, to feel for the characters, and to care about the alleged conspiracy. None of this ever even comes close to happening.  ****MILD SPOILERS******  There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Incoherent and totally non-sensical plot. 2.) Annoying style-over-substance \"MTV\" camerawork. 3.) Moronic characters and plot holes.  Allow me to elaborate.  1.) Apparently, when this movies was being made, they couldn\\'t decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies, the stigmata, or possession. So, guess what? They combined them! An aetheist gets possessed by a dead person, who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy. How a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained, nor even talked about. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives her the Stigmata. WHY? Why not just spit it out? Instead, we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices, carving cryptic messages on cars, and writing messages on walls. Apparently this priest was also a violent guy, because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters, while talking in that cliched, harsh, \"possessed\" voice that we all have heard countless times. This also starts to tie into my second complaint, because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata, she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air, and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake? Why does this happen? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director thought it looked \"cool\".  2.) This movies contains dozens of shots, in slow motion, of course, of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off, and most annoyingly, of water dripping. This woman\\'s apartment is constantly dripping water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place would probably fall apart with this many holes. To sum up this complaint, towards the end, and for absolutely no reason, the camera cuts to shots of water dripping, in slow motion, in reverse!! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has no relevance to anything, and once again, I\\'m betting it\\'s because the director thought it looked \"cool\".  3.) One of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science. This doesn\\'t make sense to me. I would think that going to church would be enough, but no, he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest. I just don\\'t buy it. Secondly, there are lots of plot holes, a few of which I will elaborate on below. For starters, when she first gets the stigmata, the scene ends with her laying unconscious, bleeding. Next, she\\'s in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another one is towards the end, when the previously mentioned \"scientific priest\" character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl. He says, \"Take me as your messenger!\" Not a word for word quote, but you get the idea. His response? \"You have no faith, only doubt!\" So, because of this, he possesses an aetheist! An aetheist has no faith, far less then any scientific priest! And then, there\\'s the fact that the object of this movie\\'s conspiracy, this Lost Gospel (of St. Thomas, I believe) is available at local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to supress this document, but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it. Maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history, where it isn\\'t wide known, but the movie never tries to tell us this, or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document\\'s uncovering.  In closing, this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree. It is my arch-nemesis, which I feel the need to insult every chance I get. I loathe it. Final Grade: F'\n",
      " b\"There is not one thing about this movie that is good.  The first half of the movie focuses on this guy shooting up, and hanging out with half-naked men. The guy's friend overdoses and dies, causing him to continue his downward spiral into street drugs which completely turns him into a junkie.  Suddenly, the junkie starts to hallucinate, and see his dead friend (who is still half-naked, even as a mirage) who tells him to kill people. The junkie obliges, and starts to murder random people who come into the business (that looks more like an abandoned warehouse) where he is working, since everybody in town somehow has a key to the front door.  Despite the jackhammer being attached to an extension cord, the junkie is still able to chase people and kill them, easily. And, for some reason, when he is injected with what looks like radioactive waste, it actually gives him superpowers, and he regains all his stamina and is able to jump onto rooftops from the ground (after falling off of them).  The acting is atrocious, the story is incredibly boring, the make-up was crappy, the dialogue was terrible, etc. basically, just everything about this movie was complete garbage.  And, seriously, what was up with all of the half-naked men? I think every male character stripped for absolutely no reason at all. I'm glad they all got killed by a super-powered, jackhammer-wielding drug addict.\"\n",
      " b'I missed the beginning of this film, which might account for why I disliked it so much. On the other hand I\\'ve studied the fall of the Roman republic for years so I know the story. Then again, that might also be the reason why I disliked this film.  The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Though it\\'s so inaccurate that I don\\'t think they made an attempt for it to be correct, in which case it can be forgiven. The odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing. Like throwing in Antonius\\' marriage to Octavia, and then pushing it aside two scenes later. Why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never even seen? And like calling Antonius by his actual name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes.  Though historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn\\'t for the leading lady. There isn\\'t an ounce of dignity in her. She\\'s hysterical, dramatical, and completely lacking control of herself. Instead of being a clever and composed queen Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS. 95% of that comes from the poor acting, but 5% is also from poor script writing. Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script. Sometimes you weren\\'t watching Antonius and Cleopatra, you were watching immature versions of Dawson and Joey from \"Dawson\\'s Creek\".  If you want to watch something about this period, watch... anything but this.'\n",
      " b'When I was a wee lad steeped in Conan Doyle\\'s original Sherlock Holmes stories, this movie struck me as plain awful. It was painful to see Sherlock as a tourist in a wildly inappropriate DC milieu (the back-projected crazy quilt of Washington monuments on his drive around town makes it seem the chauffeur is on crack), spouting pax Americana patriotism and even paying tribute to the crime-fighting superiority of the FBI (??!!). Nigel Bruce was a particular affront as a doddering Dr. Watson, noisily sucking down ice cream sodas and struggling to read 30 pages on a 10-hour transatlantic flight.   But time has been kind to \"SH in Washington.\" This was the first of these movies written by Bertram Millhauser, who always came up with witty dialogue for Rathbone and Bruce and snarky bits of malice for the supporting cast. Basil Rathbone gives a hopped-up performance as Holmes, barking out ludicrously improbable deductions and even reprising his Louis XI imitation as a limp-wristed \"eccentric\" collector. There is a small gem of a performance from Gerald Hamer (unbilled, sadly) as the master spy who sets the plot in motion -- he gives the movie a few whiffs of danger, intrigue and poignance. And it\\'s hard to dislike a movie with two Moriartys: silky sadist Henry Daniell and glittery-eyed psycho George Zucco. By the way, the suspense hinges on the fate of a fast-dwindling book of matches, so if you\\'re trying to quit smoking, this is not the movie for you.'\n",
      " b\"For those of you who saw the first Dragonheart, which was a WONDERFUL MOVIE and I suggest you see it, you should know the second one makes VERY LITTLE SENSE.  Point A. If Draco was the LAST DRAGON, how are there other dragons now?! There's like a million of them running around in China or something! Point B. After Draco died he completed the constellation Draco, so tell me if it's completed because the last dragon is there how are there other dragons?!  I thought this movie was lacking plot, good acting, and it made little sense prior to the first movie. I give it two thumbs down.\"\n",
      " b\"Yet another example of the complete waste of UK Lottery money. Just how commercial did this film prove. The Film Council ,who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded, on one of the London Undergrounds disused stations, for allowing this clich\\xc3\\xa9d, dismal specimen to be committed to film, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, most notably Deathline. Amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute. It's a little bit too late then! Surely all those development executives, at the UK Film Council, could have noticed this at the script stage. Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare.\"\n",
      " b\"I don't normally write reviews, in fact, I never write reviews. This film was so atrocious it actually inspired me to start. Virtual Sexuality attempts to be a light hearted and cheeky teenage comedy regarding the usual trappings; virginity, boys etc. except the main character apparently turns into her perfect boy that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair.   Sound interesting? Well, it isn't. The acting is the most half-hearted and appalling I have ever seen. The unfortunate thing is they appear to be genuinely supportive of script and movie, which probably explains why I have never seen them in any memorable production since. I have not bothered to learn the actors names, nor their characters. The lading lady does not enrapture or charm you and, thus, you do not care for her whatsoever. The leading lady's male friend raises no sympathy even when the script is vociferously screaming for you to pity him. The only rise he will get out of you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half decent actor was the blonde leading man, who, despite his miserably weak role, really gave it all he could, which wasn't much in the light of such a horrendous piece of work. I will not even talk about the acting abomination that are the 'bad guys' of the plot. But then again, what plot?  I watched this film unfold incredulously, as I had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish audacity to write such a script, nevermind produce, act in, and direct it. I can only wonder. The only reason my companion and I continued to watch such a mangled example of film was the disbelieving laughter it managed to arise out of us as cohesion, logic, class and even impotent storyline were disregarded within half an hour into the film. I have completely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the movie industry by releasing this to the public. This is a joke of a film and is best left to gather dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. If that.\"\n",
      " b\"This is essentially Basic Instinct, but worse. The story is lame, Caruso's character is not developed at all, and Fiorentino is a monotonous mope throughout.  If you go back and watch Basic Instinct, you will be appalled at how similar the plots are in these two films. A previous user suggested that Ezterhaus was unhappy with the way the film deviated from his script. However, Ezterhaus should still be taken to task for writing yet another movie about a wildly successful and sexually adventurous female psychologist/author that lives in San Francisco and is under investigation for murder.\"\n",
      " b\"This film is outstanding! On this date of APR, 8 2007 it was on On demand from show time. It had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature Thomas Jane in the first role i seen him in. At first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked, with a wife that seems close to going her own way. The directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot. Trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry, Paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal. Meeting up with his old road pal Nick played by Aaron Eckhart was cool at first, and he even loans him his wife's car to take care of some business. Then he spots nicks silver briefcase, and the day changes for the weird and violent. There is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes. But, Paulina's Dallas steals the show i think. Her telling of a Casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application, is outrageous. As a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy,but as with any rule there are exceptions. Paulina is as one has never seen her before in films. Sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with Tom Selleck, but with a never seen before malevolence. If your looking for film to add to your collection, this one is worth the price. Paulina in the nude is worth the price alone, but this story has everything one might hope one has. Love,friendship,sex and violence in a terrific mix. When i first seen it years ago it blew my mind, and i know you will feel the same way.\"\n",
      " b\"SCARY MOVIE 4 does live up to the SCARY MOVIE premise-That being able to offer up stupid humor (and it does get stupid) and make us laugh at that incredibly stupid stuff. That said, this one (for me) falls a tad below part 3, which I thought (and still do) is the best in the bunch. I will say that part 4 does offer up some funny stuff. The funniest scene to me is when Cindy and Brenda arrive at 'The Village'. They are hiding in the bushes and see 2 village girls about ready to walk right by them. They decide that they need to pull these girls into the bushes and beat them for their clothes so Cindy and Brenda don't look out of place. They do this, the bushes move around for a bit and, finally, 2 girls emerge from the bushes. But it's not Cindy and Brenda. It's the 2 village girls. When Cindy and Brenda do emerge into view, they are disheveled and a little tired out. Funny stuff. Though some jokes misfire, this is still better than part 2.\"\n",
      " b'PRC earned its reputation for bad movies, but \"Border Feud\" is from \"The New PRC\" and actually is pretty good.  Director Ray Taylor was usually capable and, except for some script supervising or directing errors, this runs pretty smoothly.  Al \"Fuzzy\" St. John would have been funnier -- seriously, he seldom makes a move that isn\\'t at least a little funny -- if he hadn\\'t been quite so intrusive, which is not his fault but that of the script or director.  Most of the characters are played by competent to even talented actors, even though most of them never became stars.  Except Al \"Lash\" La Rue, as it is spelled in the credits on this movie.  He seldom gets the compliments I think he deserved. Really, he is more than competent although, as another commenter said, there should have been more whip work.  La Rue and St. John were both very good cowboys, and \"Lash\" seems to have done most of his own stunt work.  The score wasn\\'t always appropriate but it was always nice music and composer Albert Glasser should have been given screen credit.  To those of us for whom there is hardly such a thing as a bad western, \"Border Feud,\" despite a misleading and pointless title, is a good one.  My copy is on a disk from \"The Treasure Box Collection,\" and, except for being a few generations too old, is in pretty good shape.  There is also another Lash La Rue film, \"Ghost Town Renegades,\" on the back side of the disk, although he is \"LaRue\" in that film\\'s credits.'\n",
      " b\"When I first bought this movie, I had my doubts about it, even though the cast was pretty impressive. But after seeing it, I really do not regret spending the money. In fact, I'd love to spend it again and again and again on movies like this.... An absurd combination of humor, drama, thrill and the big questions. This is exactly what makes it a Great movie. Okay, some might not enjoy what they see, and some might even turn it off after a little while. your loss. It's got a wonderful way of dealing with the issues we've all been through in one way or the other, and the characters you think you won't enjoy the company of throughout the movie, turns out to be the ones you really come to love after a short while. For anyone with an open mind, and a sense of humor and living - watch this movie, I promise you you won't be disappointed!\"\n",
      " b'Not as bad as some people say...This is a unofficial Bond movie and a remake of \"Thunderball\", written by Kevin McClory (co- producer in \"Thunderball\"). Well, the cast is very very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a great Bond- villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are just like the \"original\" Bond- girls, plus Rowan Atkinson and a truly great Edward Fox, who looks really refreshing in the \"M\" role. In fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses. Sean Connery does it once more confident and charming, except that he looks a little bit too old. But alright, he is the original Bond and it was great to see him once more in this role. The locations are also typical- Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really fails is the music score, the song \"Never say never again\" is O.K., but the theme song is just missing. All in one, a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly Roger Moore movies like \"Moonraker\". Only if there was another story, \"Thunderball\" was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake'\n",
      " b'I thought the \"meat\" of this movie was fair, it was the parts leading up to it and the ending that were awful. This might have done a lot better as a much shorter film. Even at only an hour and 20 minutes, it was about 30 minutes to long.  The character development is *weak*. If you\\'re not going to bother doing some real character development, don\\'t do it at all. For the first 25 minutes, I could have been watching my girlfriend and I go through our daily ups and downs. If I wanted to watch that, I\\'d just video tape any random couple for a day and have all the footage I needed. The acting was fair at best. The chemistry between these two never worked for me. The bedroom scene was really a mystery to me. Here\\'s our lovely female lead, nude in bed. Boyfriend jumps in, they kiss, she wonders aloud if she\\'s in the mood, they kiss, she decides she\\'s not in the mood but wants to talk. He rolls over and they go to bed. I very much felt the only reason scenes like this were in the movie was to make it long enough to turn into a \"feature\" picture and put in theaters. Some of the deleted scenes reinforce this point as we\\'re subjected to a scene that shows the alarm going off, the characters laying in bed, struggling to wake up, and then a 30 second shot slowly closing in on the ceiling fan. That\\'s right, 30 seconds of ceiling fan action. Dramatic! I thought the ending was hacky as well, as if the writer had no idea how to end this movie. Techncailly, they didn\\'t, as it was based on a true story and the true persons who experienced this are, of course, dead. Boyfriend has bled out from a shark bite inflicted late the previous day. Girlfriend pushes him away and he is quickly devoured by sharks. The last scene shows girlfriend commit suicide by drowning herself. First off...it\\'s hard to drown yourself without weights. The body is naturally buoyant and it would take a heck of a lot willpower to keep from jerking your head above the water. Drowning hurts. A lot. The vast majority of the population would surface to stop the pain.  Secondly, how do we know this person committed suicide? Why not show the final image of the girlfriend adrift by herself? For me, that would have been a lot more dramatic than seeing her commit suicide in suspect fashion.  Had this movie started as the couple boarded the boat and ended with the camera slowly pulling back from girlfriend, alone in the water, I would have given it 6 stars. Combined with the hackey front \"half\" of the movie and the cop-out of an ending, I was pretty unsatisfied.'\n",
      " b'It\\'s not the worst movie I have seen, but I\\'m sorry to say it was a GIANT let-down compared to its predecessors.  They should\\'vie stayed off making it. Or at least saved up a little bit more material before having another go.  There are a few serious pokes in the general direction of various American famous people and it\\'s hard not to enjoy them. I laughed hard when I realized they were going do do a remake of the \"Tom Cruise jumps in Oprah Winfrey\\'s lounge\" but my laugh got stuck in my throat quickly as they overdid it.  They stretched almost all material too thin. It\\'s sad because I thought the previous Scary Movie movies were good fun.'\n",
      " b'Long-time fans of the original GREY GARDENS documentary were probably pleased that this \"movie\" treatment of the subject would fill in some gaps in the back story of these two unique denizens of Eastern society -- \"How did they get to this?\" is the question that always comes to mind when watching the Maysles Brothers\\' astonishing 1975 chronicle. But I doubt that anyone was expecting a movie that spends close to 70% of its running time wallowing in the most boring fictionalized melodrama seen outside of network television in years and which relegates the fading divas of the dilapidated, Gothic ruin we so knew and loved (or hated, as the case may be) to an afterthought. This is the kind of TV movie one would expect to be assigned to the likes of Melissa Joan Hart and Loni Anderson (or, perhaps, Delta Burke!). And maybe the likes of them could have turned this into a fun wallow for 90 minutes or so, upping the camp value considerably.  The two lead actresses, of course, are the draw for everyone who watches this movie -- and they are each, to different degrees, disappointing. Collectively, though, they\\'re a disaster. Jessica Lange comes closest, as Big Edie, to a convincing portrayal, since she builds her character from the inside out and doesn\\'t depend on impersonation, but still falls short because she holds back (as has always been her habit as an actress), especially in the later scenes. \"Less is more\" is an invaluable guideline for actors, but sometimes you just have go a little bit more over the top, even toward the grotesque, when it depicts a character more accurately. Drew Barrymore, on the other hand, depends on constructing Little Edie from the outside in, and obviously didn\\'t get to spend enough time in that skin to ever own it. You get to see the gears moving constantly -- Accent! Accent! Accent! -- but you never get to see the force of nature that was the real Little Edie. The biggest problem, of course, is that these two opposite approaches clash in every scene they\\'re in together and the two stars don\\'t appear to be acting in the same movie.  The depiction of Al and David Maysles as cardboard cutouts was just appalling, too. That two such walking pieces of cellophane could have come up with a documentary that was so full of passion and truth is incomprehensible.  It was fascinating to watch the \"Making of\" featurette that is included on the DVD release, which repeatedly alternates between scenes from the original documentary and scenes from the HBO movie. There were several times when I got lost as to whether I was looking at Jessica Lange or the real Big Edie -- the *demeanour*, especially when she was languishing in bed, was so similar. The same thing never happened with Barrymore and Little Edie. Whenever the real Little Edie appears on screen the energy level shoots up 10-fold. Her cat-like nervous attention, the intense gaze in her beady little eyes, those Kamikaze lurches at the camera -- none of those things were present in Barrymore\\'s performance.  I gave the film a rating of three here, just to acknowledge the excellent production values -- the costumes, especially, were spectacular (and unusually accurate in the \\'40s and \\'50s scenes). But I\\'ll watch the real Beales of East Hampton a dozen times again before I sit through this travesty a second time.'\n",
      " b\"When you're not expecting much, it doesn't take a masterpiece to impress you. I watched The Sex Monster knowing that it had a bisexual-relevant theme, but uncertain of whether it would be a positive or negative portrayal of bisexuality and sexual experimentation in general. I was not disappointed.  Mike Binder somehow managed to take all of the tired stereotypes about gender and sexuality, weave them into exaggerated characters, put the characters in awkward situations, and make it all uproariously hilarious. Some viewers, no doubt, will interpret the caricatured portrayals as perpetuating outmoded stereotypes and perhaps even contributing to those stereotypes. But Binder's wit is both subtle and blatant: the dialogue makes use of every cliche imaginable, yet is still fresh and funny.  If you're cheek is prepared to accommodate your tongue, definitely see this movie (rent it! and then buy it to show all your friends). Be warned, though, that what you assume about people may be forever changed.\"\n",
      " b\"This production, and the wonderful music from it, was an important part of our family's Christmas tradition for many years-until the Long Play records were finally broken by one of the grandchildren. Although the story line was obviously very familiar, the stage craft and music gave new life to Dickens beloved Christmas tale. The casting was truly inspired -with Basil Rathbone the best of the lot. The original musical score was extremely clever and well done by some of the best artists (both from popular and classical venues)of that time. It's a shame that a video reproduction of performance is not readily available in tape or compact disc form. It would be wonderful if I could purchase a copy of the record of the musical score or if someone could burn a compact disc from a copy and allow me to purchase the same. Thanks very much.\"\n",
      " b'Though the plot elements to \"The Eighth Day\" seem like they have been done plenty of times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery, and symbolism that Jaco Van Dormal\\'s first film had. Though not as good as \"Toto the Hero\", which will always remain on my favorites list, the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, from 2001\\'s flavorless \"The Closet\" downplays his part, afraid to overact (rightfully so, the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic). However, I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it, focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the character\\'s growth.  Don\\'t walk into this movie expecting the dark humor and unexpected twists that you got from \"Toto the Hero\" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent, if not flawed, movie'\n",
      " b\"I watched this movie as a rental, knowing nothing about it beforehand, and was very pleasantly surprised. This film is far more original than most of what comes out of Hollywood, and was one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year. Like all sci-fi, it does require suspension of disbelief to go along with the idea that one could see/interact with the past (and the technology that makes it possible), but once you've that single premise, Deja Vu is one of the most captivating films to come out in awhile. Most of the haters on this board seem to have gotten too twisted up in the plot turns and time travel to enjoy the film. This is not a movie that you'll want to walk away from for a few minutes without pausing, but if you pay attention through it all, you'll find that the conclusion is just about bulletproof, and you got more than your money's worth at the video store.\"\n",
      " b'Tom Conti,(who was nominated for an Oscar for this role as Gowan Mcland), gives one of the most brilliant acting performances I have ever seen. I was looking forward to more meaty roles from this great actor, but he seems to have disappeared, leaving this film as his greatest legacy. His character is a genius who is out of control, but Conti\\'s talent depicts his situation as comic and tragic at the same time-no small feat-- while being absolutely sympathetic. To today\\'s audiences, the pace may seen slow, but all is redeemed by the ending. This has by far the best ending of any motion picture, ever. The fact that this film is not out on DVD is shameful. Interestingly, this is Kelly McGillis\\' \"introducing\" film; she was showcased and it was made clear that she was expected to be a great star. She does shine in this role. The more relevant social commentary is the portrayal of women, after they have lost that flush of young love, tend to become disillusioned. We are left wondering whether Geneva Spofford (McGillis\\' character) will become like the other sad society women around her. See this movie if you have the chance-it won\\'t disappoint.'\n",
      " b'Wow, did I just have a crazy last 24 hours! In the space of only a day, I have managed to see two of the fifty films listed in \"The Fifty Worst Films Of All Time\" by Harry Medved (a classic book that is now, unfortunately, out of print). After first seeing the very bellicose VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, I just finished watching THE TERROR OF TINY TOWN--purported to be the only all-midget Western ever made. With such a claim, it\\'s no wonder that bad film lovers like myself are drawn to this insanely offensive film! I mean, think about it...audiences across America were expected to watch and laugh at a film whose sole \"humorous\" element was that the actors were midgets!! Well, despite being a very bad and offensive film, in a way it was still oddly fun when it wasn\\'t being creepy. In a \"Bevis and Butthead\" sort of way, I suppose most people might smile when they first see the diminutive actors and actresses riding tiny ponies and acting like \"normal\" Western actors--though this enjoyment is a bit unsettling when you think about it! What was worse than this, though, was one of several musical numbers which was sung by a cabaret singer in a bar. This scantily clad wench sang about \"making love with me\" and seeing this tiny woman singing such a suggestive song made me feel a bit uneasy...no, now that I think about it, it made me queasy. Also, while the other songs weren\\'t sleazy like this one, they did seem to portray the actors and actresses as happy little children. Again, this sure was disturbing!   The plot was in many ways much like an old Gene Autrey film but with midgets. Some of them, like the lead Billy Curtis, were actually pretty good actors and could ride their ponies well. I was particularly amazed at Curtis\\' horsemanship when he stopped the runaway midget stage coach. But, many of the actors looked as if they were ready to fall off their ponies and others could barely deliver their lines. Oddly, about half of the midgets spoke with German accents!   So here\\'s the final verdict. Is it bad enough to make the bottom 50 of films? Probably not--as there must be at least 50 films worse than this. But this is STILL hardly a glowing endorsement!! No, it\\'s still deserving only of 1 star and perhaps, if you are a bad film fan, it\\'s worth a look. Otherwise, watch this mess at your own peril.'\n",
      " b\"This is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans, and considering it's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it's story lines are complex and twisting, and it's characters show realistic depth and dimension. The CGI created by the crew is breathtaking. While it's first season might be a little shaky, it's final few are well thought out and well shot. Some fans might have thought that the Star Trek Franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of Enterprise, but these fans don't take no for an answer. I recommend this to fans and newcomers alike, 10/10 hidden frontier crew.  Make it so...\"\n",
      " b'\\'Intervention\\' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. I\\'m a middle-aged married father of two. I\\'m quite functional in my personal and professional life. Still, I have pain from my past that I use addictions to soothe, and issues from which I am slowly recovering. When these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family.  The show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. Many of us suffer because it\\'s too scary to go back and do, as Alice Miller says, \"the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood.\" The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. This digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. So much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. Often it\\'s assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self-interest, and now they can\\'t stop. Not so: addictions are about killing pain. I can relate to the different events and hardships in people\\'s lives. There are common themes, and surprising exceptions. Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. Some kids simply respond badly to divorce. To those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, I would just say that different people respond differently. Although some kids handle divorce well, others, like Cristy in the show, \"collapse in a heap on the floor\" and have their lives forever changed by the event.  For example, last night\\'s counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men. She strips for cash for a 75-year old neighbor and lets men abuse her. Sound familiar to anyone? The series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives. Often it\\'s those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. As they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it\\'s made your life miserable.  To the producers: Thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. Also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant.  To the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. Whether or not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.'\n",
      " b'I\\'m sorry. I know that I\\'m going to get my head bitten off, but Halle Berry is not as great of an actress that everyone wants her to be. I have been extremely disappointed for years with Halle\\'s performances. In this movie, there was no exception. It seems that if there is a sex scene, that is when we see her act her best. Spoken parts just seem not to be her strong suit. Michael Ealy is generally a powerful actor in movies he is in. But I was not feeling Tea Cake at all. It has always been said that: \"The book is always better than the movie.\" And this is true, but sometimes the movie can be as effective as the book it is portraying. But this movie was highly disappointing. I\\'m a black college student and I read this book my freshmen year in college. I was moved by this wonderful piece of art and excited when they said that there was going to be a movie. While watching the movie, I was shaking my head and thinking of better characters to play in this movie. And I can name plenty. It might be a good movie to watch, if you are a Halle Berry fan. If you aren\\'t really a fan, don\\'t bother.'\n",

Jimmie Walker\\'s okay. There\\'s slightly better acting than in Airport \\'75 but what film doesn\\'t have better acting than Airport \\'75? One thing I liked about this film is that it had more going on than a lot of other disaster films plot-wise. At least they made an attempt at subplots. What really hurts this film is the special effects - ugh! Not too special if you ask me.

After all the previous ones I've seen (havent seen 3 & 4 yet) this one I found the best.  I like the intro to these movies as they give a brief explanation of pokemon, this movie showed a few scenes from the previous movies.  The starting fight between the alien poke and the earth one was cool, showing off the aliens strength for a little while.  I liked the few scenes just with poke doing amusing things with feelgood background music.  Ash is the focus of course, a few new characters and poke are introduced, and its good to see Tory make friends with those plus and minus pokemon.  After the end you see everyone board a train and go their separate ways which ended it nicely.  Really enjoyable movie in the hi tech city.\"\n",
      " b\"A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.  This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, Billie, who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy. She is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody. Overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence, a chase ensues, and finally she is rescued by Andy who take her home as they alert the police. The trouble is... there is no body, no evidence that anything of the sort took place. Even so, a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie's side of the story....  And to say more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate, clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller, it's one that pays its dues to movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts, deadpan humor, Americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless, and nail-biting suspense until it seems something must snap. Even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy, the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots (for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away. Very smart.\"\n",
      " b\"(spoilers??)  I wasn't sure what to think of the movie. Not too much of a kids film. Definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying. But I was surprised that I was a bit entertained by it.  I was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had. (even less without the credits) And the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature. But alas, they torture him. Right until the end of the movie. Those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars. But I do recommend the movie. Even for a sequel.  8/10  Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable:7/10\"\n",

She wanted to leave halfway through the movie which was fine with both her parents! The parts we did see were only occasionally humorous, mostly either too silly or gross. I would expect that this movie might appeal to kids between 9-12, if that. It\\'s definitely not suited for younger children. From what I\\'ve heard the original series was by far superior and if you are going to \"relive the past\" you\\'ll probably be disappointed.'\n",
      " b'This movie, even though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving, strong film. Bette Davis, as the slutty, vicious Cockney waitress Mildred is absolutely believable. Watching her performance is still spellbinding. She makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time. Leslie Howard\\'s performance as the weak, obsessed Phillip Carey is not as strong, but I don\\'t see how any actor could hold their own against Ms. Davis\\'s performance. She chews up the scenery in every scene she is in, totally stealing the show. This is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the Academy Award, but lost. It was shocking for it\\'s day what with themes of unwed pregnancy, multiple sex partners, and Mildred\\'s vicious language so it is somewhat dated, but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she REALLY thinks of him (\"You cad, you dirty swine....\") is still some of the greatest acting I have ever seen on film.'\n",
      " b\"Steve Buscemi is one of the greatest actors of all time, in my opinion, for the simple fact that he makes all of his characters memorable.  This film is an accurate look at life for the guys who never really made the cut and were left behind in a world full of unused degrees and previous money.  The film is depressing, and therefore I'd recommend everyone watch it, especially those who were born into their own perfect little worlds and became what they are because of their parents' money. This one is for the tools of society that don't think that these people exist or think that they are merely peons. Get a clue; this was once the working population of the country.\"\n",
      " b'\"Read My Lips\" tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain, socially maladroit female office worker (Devos) and her workplace trainee, a crude excon (Casel). As the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. Good stuff for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. In French with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (B+)'\n",
      " b'Me neither, but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful, which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time. There\\'s nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie, and My Name is Modesty: Whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level. It\\'s full of B-actors but isn\\'t any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously. It sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growing-up drama, flashback style. The beautiful Alexandra Staden, smothered beyond recognition under makeup, more resembles a cast member from Top Model than Modesty Blaise. I\\'m not one of those die-hard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious \"graphic novels\" to be pitch-perfect - in fact I\\'ve never even read Modesty Blaise - all I wanted was a decent movie to watch. But this wasn\\'t it. The film feels half-finished, with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot. It also takes its audience for idiots, explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago (I guess they think we all have Alzheimers).  Now I love a good B-movie - what\\'s better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a Calzone? - and \"Modesty\" is directed by none other than Scott Spiegel, who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money! I loved From Dusk Till Dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad B-movie should bring to the table - nudity, gore, guns, you name it. \"Modesty\" is just dull. The flashback concerning Modesty\\'s life isn\\'t interesting. The acting isn\\'t bad enough to be laughed at. In fact, I kinda liked Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau\\'s (hey buddy, pseudonyms are your friends!) performance as the baddie.  So overall it\\'s just lame. Weak. Uninspired. Call it what you will. Don\\'t watch anything because Tarantino presents it, people. This is just a very forgettable, half-hearted thriller, and it never tries to be more than that. Allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun (seriously, even I\\'m cringing): My Name Is Modesty: A Modesty Waste of Time - 4/10'\n",

Her good humor and hardiness inspire everyone around her, and those with the courage to go in with her are rewarded. The beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure. Despite the length it was never boring to me. These ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story. Someone borrowed my VHS a few years ago and I never saw it or them again.

      " b\"O.K. is the only possible way of analyzing this movie. It does what it set out to do. But if you have seen this movie and were disapointed, did you really think it was going to be as funny or enjoyable as earlier entries in the Pink Panther series? The movie's comedy is very lukewarm. Whether this is the fault of Blake Edwards, or maybe he intended it to be that way is unknown. Roberto Benigni is the Son. O.K, he is now an academy award winner, but in 1993 a complete unknown. If anyone on the movie wanted it to be a success then a bigger name should have been chosen, a David Jason, Dudley Moore or Rowan Atkinson. Benigni, does quite a good impersonation of Peter Sellers throughout the movie, but this aside isn't very funny or charming. The return of cast members like Herbert Lom, Graham Starke, Burt Kwouk and Liz Smith is good. But overall the movie seems forced and is something of a hit and miss. Lets hope the upcoming Mike Myers remake breathes new life into this series.\"\n",

It\\'s based on the book by George Sessions Perry called \"Hold Autumn in Your Hand,\" but the movie and the book are completely different in style and manner. I personally like the movie more, as it showed the family\\'s togetherness much better than the book. A wonderful Renoir film (I think my favourite of all his) and definitely a must see. The courage of the family is really touching. I gave it a...10/10.'\n",
      " b\"Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a major B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel, an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something. It's less entertaining than the first one: in all aspects. But it's although worthy a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former WWE stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels, even if they are direct or not.  Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below the average, I think he isn't made to the job. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing amazing, nothing far from alright.  Technical details, well, a production made by Sony can't be great. Cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable. Whatever, just watch it if you want. If you watch, you won't lose anything. But if you don't... well, you won't lose either.\"\n",

If this is the first time you are hearing about Peak Oil, you are among the majority of the population. Peak Oil doesn't mean 'running out of oil', but rather 'running out of cheap and plentiful oil'. Inexpensive oil supports our very way of life, as we know it. It is crucial for our transportation, food production, economy and basically everything that we use on a daily basis.  In his 2006 State Of The Union address, President Bush publicly acknowledged for the first time that we are addicted to oil. Unfortunately, that's only part of the story. Addictions of any kind can result in catastrophe when the supply falls short or the costs rise beyond reach before curing the addiction. You owe it to yourself and future generations to learn more today.  It is time for all Americans to take individual responsibility for our future. Our industrial society, built on cheap and readily available oil, must be completely redesigned and overhauled \\xc2\\x85 immediately.

      " b\"There are two kinds of characters on THE SHIELD: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing, and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes, and everyone's only hope. More than any other show, THE SHIELD is about hypocrisy and self-delusion. Unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-deluders are the shows heroes, and as such have the typical genre-fiction heroes' improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again, making fools out of all of their peers.  The show boasts excellent camera-work. The lead ins and the fade outs are always superb. It really is a work of art to see. Unfortunately the story is a cartoony, overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence, rape, and lies.  The hero, who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme, is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character, always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds (anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show, always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice, and ALWAYS scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications. If another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing, and someone gets hurt because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious cop, regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause. Every time.  Like 24, this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season. Boring, unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody, perverted chunks of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover-ups.  Most disappointing though, is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth, to and away form the characters on whims. Sometimes, they want us to see Shane as the enemy. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul. Sometimes they want us to see Vic as a dangerous, sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold. Sometimes they want us to see Mara as a low down vile Jezebel. Then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with Shane, that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic.  None of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want. Once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends, that's it. It is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth. But then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right under everyone's noses.\"\n",

I\\'m very disappointed by this \"adaption\" of the famous book. and i bet heinrich harrer was, too... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.'\n",

In fact, I found the premise genuinely creepy, the effects highly believable, and the presence of Donald Sutherland to be a masterful touch. It may not go down in the all-time pantheon of \"greatest sci-horror films\" ever, but if it was playing on HBO I wouldn\\'t change the channel. Sometimes I think people get too caught up in whether a story is true to the original, and forget that it\\'s JUST a movie and they should try to enjoy it on that basis.'\n",

It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly\\'s mom. Jaime is....well...GORGEOUS! This flick wasn\\'t so much made to be a \"breakthrough\" movie, rather, it was intended to life in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant by different guys, and all the guys drive rusted-out \\'66 Ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that\\'s the picture everyone sees when you mention \"trailer park\"). Some people over-analyze movies (case-in-point: Star Trek freaks).

This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. After barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who\\'s under the control of Jim Jones-type cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical mad guru-style things, like passing out LSD, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping Agren with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood. Every once in awhile a character will look to the right or left and see a gory scene lifted directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both of which were also directed by Lenzi). I\\'m pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST as well. Here we get the expected animal slaughter scenes (gutting a gator; natives eating live snakes), plus some additional nudity and a castration. Me Me Lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout playing a widow who is gang banged by three of her brother in laws on top of the ashes of her freshly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer briefly appears as a professor and isn\\'t given much to do.  So anyway, with MANGIATI VIVI! you pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles, so if you\\'re a sleaze hound, by all means watch it. Personally, I got bored with it about midway through and just wanted it to end. The original (heavily cut) U.S. release in 1985 was titled THE EMERALD JUNGLE in order to trick people into thinking they were actually renting John Boorman\\'s EMERALD FOREST.

After solid turns in Girl Can't Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter it seemed Jayne was well on the way to becoming one of Tinsel Town's hottest stars. However, an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated Mansfield to the sidelines, namely cheap Euro loan-outs until Fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.  This movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone's time with the exception of Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her grating performance for this film's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns Jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing (simply for the sake of appearing with Grant) to portray this squealing, idiotic menace. Her character of Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves. We all know Jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding. A real shame.  Steer clear of this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than funny.\"\n",
      " b\"This movie has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness, but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is that of the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ-betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie. Judas' passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can sense the angst. Peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerfully portrayed as the Judas drama. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and provocative Christ, whether believable or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS, to use in study or discussion groups.\"\n",

Matthau is content playing the field without commitment until he meets single mother Glenda Jackson who insists upon being the only woman in his life while she is in his life. At the same time, he comes under pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a potential litigant in a malpractice suit, and to support the shambolic and incompetent Carney in his attempt to be re-elected Chief of Staff.  This is a superior old-fashioned romantic comedy graced by four Grade-A actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a first-rate dry, caustic and sarcastic script. Carney steals every scene he's in and, in the parlance of IMDb, has us rolling on the floor laughing out loud whenever he appears on screen. We are otherwise entertained by the on-off relationship of the two leads and various sub-plots.  Lacks the ambition to be a great film, but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable and re-watchable for its comedic value alone. Deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the DVD or video cassette.\"\n",
      " b'Crumb has not gotten its due credit. Very few films of the 1990s have been universally accepted as masterpieces. Crumb should definitely have been one of the few. On the back of the video\\'s box, it proclaims \"one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time.\" It is probably the only film of the decade besides _Schindler\\'s List_ that could have claimed that without stretching the truth. Every critic proclaimed that it was one of the very best films of the year it was released. Gene Siskel put it as his #1 picture for the year (having said in his original review \"I doubt I\\'ll see a better movie this year\"), and Roger Ebert put it as his #2 only after _Leaving Las Vegas_ (the only 1990s film I\\'d put above it myself, too).  So why do I claim that it is so great? Well, I particularly think that documentaries are much more important than fiction films if they are done well. The purpose of [great] art is to study and try to educate us about human nature. Documentaries, since they are fact and not fiction, logically can tell us more about human nature than fiction films, which can tell us about human nature, but they necessarily teach it through the eyes of the artists who created the work. For instance, _Hoop Dreams_, which has been accepted by many already to be a masterpiece, s by far the best sports film ever made. No fiction film could have had more insight into the appeal of sports. Also, it is one of the most important films ever made to deal with racial issues for the same reason.  Crumb is the most important film ever made on the subject of the artist. Never has a film had more insight into an artist\\'s work than Crumb does into R. Crumb. Each time I watch it, his artwork becomes more deep and complex. Each drawing becomes extremely multi-layered. R. Crumb was hardly inhibited while Zwigoff was filming him, nor were the other people who were interviewed. Crumb spares none of his personal life. Because of this, we learn more about him than we have ever learned about a single fictional character in film history. Not Charles Foster Kane, not Jake LaMotta, not Travis Bickle. No one.   R. Crumb is also extremely anti-capitolistic. I love this! He has inspired me with his thoughts. He never existed as an artist to make money.

In fact, if it had a first run presentation in the 1970's, I'm very surprised I missed it then. Anyway, I finally caught up with it. And, guess what? It IS one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Usually, something stands out: effective acting, great miniatures or special effects, nifty dialogue, music, scenery, or just a general feeling of fun. This has almost nothing. Admittedly, Joanna Kerns does give a spirited performance, and you can see a glimmer of the solid comedic style she developed later. But, that's it. Even the monster is bad. Not laughingly bad, which is sometimes enjoyable... just bad, with unexplainable movements and no expression. If someone suggests you watch this movie, just say NO.\"\n",
      " b'I am not a fan of musicals, but I am a huge fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director. This movie is BEAUTIFUL. The shots are like oil paintings with motion, something a lot of directors strive for but Renoir MASTERS. I cannot express how much this movie transcends itself... it\\'s not really a musical, it just has a couple of well-placed musical numbers and a grand dancing finale. But there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute JOY when watching it.  I am a fan of foreign art films, but I\\'m also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies. I get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in \"la la land,\" but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible -- not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good. 10 out of 10.'\n",

      " b\"An MGM MINIATURE Short Subject.  The editor of the Cole County Clarion must decide what is the real IMPORTANT NEWS for his readers: an impending frost which may spell disaster to their crops, or the sensational shooting-down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street.  This is an enjoyable little one-reeler, featuring a good performance by comic Charles `Chic' Sale. Today's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited James Stewart, as Sale's nephew/assistant. Slow talking & somewhat goofy, Stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time.  Often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios' feature films.\"\n",
      " b\"My friends and I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we came out, we were only slightly more informed on what the plot of the movie actually was. Though not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. Maybe have a friend rent it for you (it's not even worth the rental cost, either) if you really want to see it.  When a movie is so convoluted that you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes, there's really not much that can be said in its defense. The acting was decent, more than you'd expect to get from this movie, and some of the shots were good, but it was all bogged down by a lame plot and poor script.  This movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out, I went and purchased a ticket to see a good movie just to cleanse my mind. I recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead.\"\n",
      " b'...instead, watch it as a great coming of age tale about African American males in the mid 1960\\'s in the ghettos of Chicago. For all of you out there under the age of 50, \"What\\'s Happening\" was a light-hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) concerning a group of young African American high school kids living in a working class neighborhood. I liked it a great deal - it just has no real connection to this film. \"Cooley High\" started out as being the basis for \"What\\'s Happening\", but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences, so it was redone as a comedy, even though the credits on \"What\\'s Happening\" still read that it was based on this movie.  This film starts out light, but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent 1960\\'s and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless. The guys deal with sex, betrayal, joblessness, hopelessness, and even early death. The ending is quite powerful and serious, and the film has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either.'\n",
      " b'This blatant \"Day Today\" rip off promised a new, cutting edge BBC comedy. It\\'s nothing of the sort, rather a tepid satire on the banality of television news but without the biting humour and insight that Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci provided for \"The Day Today\" and \"Brass Eye\".  Where does \"Broken News\" fail where the older shows succeed? 1) It\\'s made itself a one trick pony: In episode one it shows the headless chicken style of modern TV news reporting, where no actual information is reported and presenters just love the sound of their own voice. Fine, after half an hour we get the joke. Then it\\'s repeated week after week. Same joke, same premise. The show doesn\\'t progress, introduce new elements or play around in its own rigid format. The American news desk will always be the same, the \"Look Out East\" crew will have suggestive banter in the same manner and Standing News was great as a one off joke, but it\\'s repeated again and again.  2) The cast. It must have seemed like a great idea in the planning stages to have quality dramatic actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Pip Torrens and Claudia Christian in a satire/sub-sketch comedy show but these things are best done by comedy actors...even a team of them. There\\'s no chemistry between the cast, which is huge (what a waste of money) and what made \"The Day Today\" and \"Brass Eye\" so good was the caricature like characters created by a smaller but gifted comedy group. Can any of the \"Broken News\" characters stand out like Alan Partridge, or Peter O\\'Hanrahahanrahan, or Austen Tasseltine or Ted Maul? The cast are playing it too serious, too real and the result is a flat comedy.  3) Blatantly stealing from \"The Day Today\". We\\'re not just talking about the concept, but the actual material as well. Frozen urine, death penalty reports by glamorous American journalists, nonsensical captions, fake football team names, overwrought graphics...all done on \"The Day Today\" and done much better.  The BBC comedy department is at one of its lowest points at the moment. It\\'s overly dependent on \"Little Britain\" and Ricky Gervais to keep it afloat for one thing. It thinks by re-hashing old comedy concepts such as \"My Family\" and \"Broken News\" it will count on getting viewers who have put much better equivalent shows out of their memories and it is fiercely loyal to character based sketch shows which can spin out episode after episode of 8 characters and their stock catchphrases. This is hardly a recipe for growth and surprise.'\n",
      " b'I can NOT believe it!!! I just \"discovered\" Freaks and Geeks and I gotta admit that at first it took me some time to get into it because I was kind of expecting a more broad, punchline based comedy but the more episodes I watched, the more I started to really dig this show AND to love the characters and I really mean LOVE! Except for Undeclared, there is not ONE TV show which develops such really and truly lovable characters. You start to feel for them in every step they take throughout the episodes. Freaks and geeks made me cry. It made me freak out. It made me jump around in my room.  That it got canceled just proves once more that no one realizes anymore what a good show is supposed to achieve. To create characters whose progression in their lives is worth watching. Just as Undeclared, which also got canceled after one season, this show is a stroke of genius which every fan of a good TV-show and yet every fan of something good at all, should watch.  And now I\\'m sitting here, disappointed that I will NEVER get to know how Freaks and Geeks could have continued. It\\'s just good to know that the makers of this are still out there doing the best comedies around.'\n",
      " b'Myrna Loy is a judge who sentences Cary Grant to Shirley Temple in \"The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer,\" also starring Rudy Vallee, Johnny Sands, Ray Collins, and Veda Ann Borg. Grant is Richard Nugent, an artist who gets into some trouble and comes before Judge Turner (Loy). He leaves court and heads for a high school to give a lecture, only to encounter Judge Turner\\'s 17 going on 35-year-old sister, Susan, played by Shirley Temple. Like the rest of the girls in the audience, Susan thinks Richard is dreamy but takes things a step further. She corners him in a room for a school paper interview and asks important artistic questions such as, \"Are you married?\" and \"Have you ever been in love?\" To get rid of her, Richard agrees to paint her portrait as America. When he returns home that evening, Susan is waiting in his apartment. Moments later, Richard is in jail, the Judge having figured out where her niece has gone. The court psychiatrist (Collins) talks the Judge into letting Susan get Nugent out of her system. It doesn\\'t sit well with Richard, or Susan\\'s quasi-boyfriend (Sands).  Grant\\'s comic timing and mastery at underplaying is evident here as he reluctantly dates Susan, even dressing down and switching cars with her boyfriend to disillusion her. The scene at the picnic, when he tries his hands (and legs) at several events is hilarious. Toward the end of the film, he takes Judge Turner to dinner; before long, the entire cast is at the table talking and arguing as the waiters continually sing \"Happy Birthday\" to one customer after another, and a diner at another table tries to retrieve Rudy Vallee\\'s chair for his own party - it\\'s a great scene. Loy is sophisticated and glamorous which belies her judge-like decorum in the courtroom, where she\\'s all sternness and intelligence. Temple is very funny as she tries to appear older and calls Grant \"Dickie.\" Her pseudosophisticated talk and haughtiness are amusing, but Temple is at her best when she\\'s being what she is - a teenager. Johnny Sands is positively adorable as her boyfriend Jerry. His bio says he got fan mail until the day he died - I can believe it.  This is such a delightful movie, with a wonderful script by Sidney Sheldon and marvelous performances. The next time you\\'re feeling blue, remember: \"You remind me of a man!\" \"What man?\" \"The man with the power!\" \"What power?\" \"The power of whodo!\" \"Whodo?\" \"You do!\" \"What?\" \"You remind me of a man!\"'\n",
      " b'I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.  The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism. I am glad these films are still around for the next generation. I hope I never out grow the magic of the muppets.'\n",

      " b'I love the absurdity and biting humor of Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel\\'s surrealist films (such as \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" and \"The Exterminating Angel\", to name two). Other, earlier works (like \"The Forgotten Ones\", about juvenile delinquents from a marginal neighborhood in Mexico) are more serious and provide a strong social message.  However, I believe it is \"Nazarin\" which most successfully shoots for the heart of the viewer. While it\\'s true that it\\'s brimming with irony, it nevertheless reveals an aspect of Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel which would appear to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest. Here, while the director (quite typically) throws countless jabs at the Catholic Church, he also appears to show, surprisingly, a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thought and its practice of selfless love.  \"What?? Luis Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel unabashedly praising a Jesus-like figure??\" I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue... that is, until I watched \"Nazarin\". My appreciation is that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following Christ\\'s example in a society infested with meanness, ignorance and sin; but he also presents the hero, Father Nazario, as quite the beacon of light amidst a sea of darkness. Without a doubt, by the end of the film I was looking up to him and not down on him!   Some would argue that Father Nazario\\'s doubts regarding his faith point to the loss of his saintly values. (Alas, if he can\\'t do good in this world, who can?) But I would say that this \"flaw\", his frustration, precisely makes his character all the more heroic, because it shows how human he is and how challenging his struggle within must be. And who says the priest couldn\\'t eventually emerge from that \"dark night\" and regain his confidence? Perhaps we\\'ve only been presented with a difficult part of his spiritual journey. The elegant, open ending (in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a female stranger) allows us to imagine ourselves the final outcome of the story.  I recognize in Bu\\xc3\\xb1uel the aggressive, self-professed atheist endowed with brilliant wit and social consciousness; but after having watched \"Nazarin\", I also sense from him a certain warmth, a depth and maturity that\\'s not so evident in his other work.  For the sake of contrast, I strongly recommend watching afterward his short film \"Simon of the Desert\" (also made in Mexico, several years later). It deals with a similar subject matter -- the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation --, only it does so in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style.'\n",
      " b'This movie takes the smoldering talents of Joan Crawford and lets them burn the screen down, right before your eyes...she\\'s utterly convincing as a fairly demented \"possessed\" lover, torn to pieces by hideous dysfunction. The lowest of lows, and not many highs...  Mildred Pierce laid the template down; Possessed fills the template and makes it its own. What I personally love is the \"Hollywood Gothic\" aspect, the redolence of that: every frame is steeped in it, every moment is cradled in its embrace. One of those movies that you watch, mouth agape, and whisper to yourself, \"Christ, the aesthetics...was the world ever really like that?\" Apparently so.   Oh, and for the record - it was a better world.'\n",
      " b\"I remember this as a rather odd affair, very male, not particularly woman friendly. A world where blokes are blokey and great, with lovable eccentricities, and women are for ogling - here merely disguised rather than mitigated by romantic pseudo poetic posturing. Rachel Weisz is lovely, but not a real woman, very definitely a male fantasy figure. This felt rather curious, especially when compared with An Evening With Gary Lineker, in which the characters, both male and female, were much better drawn. The attention to detail in the football seemed much better in that other play too, here it seemed rather desultory - a sequence of blokes cheering when goals went in and looking glum when they didn't. To sum up, really rather drippy, almost as wet as Morrissey's mustache as he sipped coffee by the Seine in a ludicrous, introspective setup that a teenager would have been embarrassed to have come up with. Shallow, silly, mooning, wet, not connected to the real world. Check out Lineker - it's much better.\"\n",
      " b'American movies about war and Nazis simply cannot be good. They can not refrain from becoming idiot and following an agenda. All Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and Americans are so modest yet so capable and sensible and human. Come on, stop this bullshit. The main character says something like \"by this trial, we have to make aggressive war a crime\". Is America a peaceful nation with its world #1 $420 billion \"defense\" budget (#2 China with just $51b)? Is it simply spent in this without any... ROI? Why portray America as a peaceful nation when it isn\\'t? I deeply dislike movies with an agenda - they throw art to hell and try to persuade us into believing something. Hollywood should put a label on movies, just as record companies have that \"parental advisory\" label. We should have a \"bullshit advisory\", \"propaganda advisory\" or a \"politically correct advisory\" label on some movies. This is one of them.'\n",
      " b\"ah yes... yet another vampire/werewolf movie. Most of those are of poor quality, ridiculous and copy off each other with great candor. This one is different in one respect... it didn't copy off other vampire movies, it copied off The Matrix. And a lot.  The director seems to be an avid admirer of the The Matrix and seemed to have included a lot of its design motifs into this movie. Including a lot of actor body language, weapon usage, wardrobe, setting and even the general color scheme. It's basically The Matrix with vampires instead of machines... with one problem, it's not even a fraction as good.  The story itself is well documented so repeating it won't help much, but what will help is to prepare you to a somewhat low budget production (or seemingly so) with poor acting (yes, even by wonderful Kate) and uncomfortable clich\\xc3\\xa9s. The story has potential (vampires vs. werewolves) but it's hard to shake off the feeling you're watching an episode of some low-budget vampire series. The dialogs are mostly predictable and shallow, and it seems the focus of this movie is on a disappointing 'cool factor' rather than absorbing the viewer into the story.  I'd recommend this movie to hardcore (and young) vampire/werewolves fans, but they'll watch it anyway... if you're not automatically taken by that theme, stay away. The biggest contribution this movie has given me was a craving to watch The Matrix again.\"\n",
      " b\"This is a sort of hidden gem. It has little to no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and it deserves all of the above! One of the great directors of cinema, Fritz Lang, has created a real gem in this excellent western. A fine cast led by Randolph Scott (in probably one of his greatest performances), the always sturdy Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others in an exciting Zane Grey story of the laying of the Western Union cable across country. It has tense drama, sprinklings of humor and great effects. It's reminiscent of DeMille in ways and yet Fritz Lang leaves his own stamp on it. At very least this is a damned good western!\"\n",
      " b'... and if you\\'re very, very good it will resemble Moon Over Parador.  This film had a slightly silly story, but it was a fantasy after all, and the casting and the acting was spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as the actor/impostor, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have. You get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes.  This was one of Dreyfuss\\'s best roles, just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator! And the parting scene: like something out of Casablanca, indeed!   Raul Julia was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police. He gets some really funny lines, some of which are homages to other films, like \"Round up the usual suspects!\"   And Sonia Braga was excellent as the girl friend -- in addition to being a really hot number: \"You should get an Oscar for tonight!\"   Let us not forget Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett -- all perfectly done.  All in all, a memorable romp under the Paradorian moon.  -R.'\n",
      " b'I remember exactly when I saw this movie. I was at one of those dollar theatres that would show a bunch of movies that had already made the rounds and I had just paid to see \"Bad News Bears - Breaking Training\"... I could only watch it for about 5 minutes and it was soooooooo bad I was having trouble keeping my popcorn down. So rather than ask for my dollar back, I just got up and walked into the movie they were screening next door. I wanted someone to stop me so I could tell them how bad the Bad News Bears movie was but no one did. So that is how I found myself in the movie \"The Cannonball Run\"... It was really funny and I was delighted to have stumbled upon it. I really hate bathroom humor but the proctologist in the ambulance really cracked me up when he put his finger out when being told he would have to examine a patient. I would recommend this movie to everyone, but males will probably enjoy it more.'\n",
      " b\"Joan Collins stars in this hilarious giant bug epic. Producer-director Bert I. Gordon, the genius behind such stuff-grows-really-big films as The Amazing Colossal Man and Village of the Giants, brings us a cautionary tale of what can happen when pollution, real-estate scams, and social insects mix. Collins, an absolute portrait of the valiant trouper who keeps plugging away no matter how bad the script gets, stars as shady land developer Marilyn Fryer. Marilyn is by only a small margin the sleaziest of a band of characters so repellent it's hard not to root for the ants (who, by the way, grow really big). A ludicrous plot and jaw-droopingly bad dialog make Empire of the Ants ideal for late-night viewing. Watch it with your most vicious circle of friends. DVD version includes the original trailer and French and Spanish subtitles.\"\n",

Along comes Marla English as a greedy murderess who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. Her idiot boyfriend, portrayed by Lance Fuller, is along on the safari. They hire \"Touch\" Connors, (later renamed Mike Connors, of Mannix fame) as a guide. English is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either. \"Touch\" (I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t even type the name without cracking up, I mean, what the...) gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that\\'s saying a lot. The monster is only seen briefly, and the ending is predictable to say the least. I would say this movie falls into the \"it\\'s so bad, it\\'s almost good\" category of movies. It\\'s good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube.'\n",

If I could I would give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest is 1 which is awful, I need to vote that. But I would say the movie is worse than awful.  Don't pain yourself by seeing this movie and hoping it will get better because I can tell you already now, it wont! I hoped that there might would come one single scene which would be worth watching. There didn't came any good scene at all.   What an excellent piece of crap.   And Coolio as a vampire? LOL! LMAO! YARGH!\"\n",

Although there is no dialogue in the film, the director\\'s visuals tell a tale all their own. The film is beautiful to look at with sharp colors, haunting music and amazing poetic images. The emotional pull of the actors makes the story both fascinating and moving. This is definitely not a \"typical\" film. It is unique, mysterious and moving, yet simple and elegant. It feels both gentle and brutal. A very emotional experience. This director\\'s first film is a stunning accomplishment. I wish I could see more films like this....it\\'s truly beautiful.'\n",

Just like Poseidon and Pink Panther, it\\'s clear Hollywood just wanted to cash in on nostalgia instead of creating quality, original concepts. Bad film on nearly every level.  Disappointing to say the least. The movie is a one note bore until John Conner\\'s one man raid to end the film. The dialogue is atrocious. Slipping in the \"I\\'ll be back\" line was as forced a line as I\\'ve ever seen. In fact, it drew an audible groan from the crowd I saw it with. Leaps in logic and rather mundane action drop this film to the bottom of the barrel in terms of summer blockbuster material. I honestly can\\'t think of one thing the director did right.

Malcolm goes to his Managing Editor and tries to resign but becomes involved with a young girl being murdered and from then on all kinds of hell breaks loose.

And then there is the cat- I have no idea how many witches (besides me) have named a cat Pyewacket but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only just as much as his character is out of p;ace in this weird sub-world of magic and witchcraft. Perfect.

While Enid and Rebecca discover that life outside of high school isn't as great as they imagined it to be, Seymour (who already knows about the loneliness of life) tries for once in his life to actually start living instead of just floating through life. Steve Buscemi, who plays Seymour, has one of his most memorable performances, and Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are perfect fits for their roles. Anyone who feels like they don't quite fit in with society will surely find something to like in this movie.

This ultimately changes the teenagers life and he grows up in the process. He learns to appreciate nature and to have a respect for the environment. I grew up in the 1960\\'s and the NBC television show \"Flipper\" was my favorite childhood show. Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as a 1990\\'s Sandy Ricks and gives an excellent performance. As much as I liked the NBC television show and MGM theatrical feature films with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960\\'s I liked this feature the best! I feel Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. With respect to Luke Halpin I feel Elijah Wood has more of a range of acting talent and emotes more as an actor which makes his performance excellent and more believable. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor working today in films. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the screenplay and has done an excellent job as both writer and director of this film. Paul Hogan gives a comical and likable performance as Sandy\\'s Uncle Porter Ricks. Mr. Hogan\\'s performance perfectly offsets Elijah\\'s role as Sandy. I am a big fan of underwater films. This film was beautifully shot in the Bahamas like \"Thunderball\" (1965 UA) was. The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S.C. who lensed the film \"Jaws\" in 1975. Mr. Butler is a very talented cinematographer. The underwater director of photography was Pete Romano. He did a superb job with the underwater cinematography. I enjoyed the film score by Joel McNeely. This good film score featured Crosby, Stills and Nash among other talented artists. This motion picture was shot in Panavision like \"Thunderball\" in the aspect ratio of 2.35:1 If possible try to see this film in a scope version as originally framed and visioned by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another very nice thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave the \"original\" Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) a small part in this remake. He portrayed Bounty Fisherman #3 in this film. This was a very kind gesture on Mr. Shapiro\\'s part! As you can tell I am a real true fan of this film. Sadly this beautiful film was met with harsh words by the majority of movie critics. I originally saw this movie on my birthday, May 31st of 1996 in a movie theater. It meant a lot to me. I have it on numerous video versions. The VHS versions are in \"pan and scan\". The laserdisc version is \"letterboxed\" 2.35:1! I even have a VCD in 2.35:1 from Hong Kong which is \"letterboxed\". But my most prized possession is an \"original\" 16mm theatrical feature print which I will treasure for the rest of my life! Thank you Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for me to enjoy!  P.S. I must add that the quality of the Universal DVD is superb! It is the best DVD as far as quality I have ever seen. The color and resolution is spectacular. The soundtrack is great. I think Universal must have used the same transfer for the DVD that they did for the laserdisc version. The 35mm scope print is \"mint\" and Alan\\'s film really has a wonderful look to it. A great tribute to a wonderful film! The DVD\\'s resolution is even superior to the laserdisc quality! It\\'s just spectacular! Thank you Universal Home Video for the great quality control and transfer. Many thank\\'s for doing a superb job on this wonderful family film. Also many thank\\'s to you Alan for all your extreme kindness to me!!! It\\'s a real honor to know you!!! (Review Revised/Updated June 27, 2005)'\n",
      " b'I\\'m proud to say I\\'m a student at UW-Milwaukee, where parts of the film were shot. Yep, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I took a film class, possibly the same course as fellow student Smith.  That\\'s where I learned about \"American Movie.\" Our professor told us about it shortly before its release. To be sure, I was intrigued, but for some reason, I put off seeing it for several months(it must\\'ve done pretty well if it was still playing, at least in Milwaukee).  When I finally got around to seeing it, I thought it was an entertaining documentary. It\\'s not a masterpiece-it goes on a bit too long-but I find Mark\\'s passion and commitment inspiring. I hope this film signals the beginnings of bigger and better things him. Maybe his forthcoming \"Northwestern\" will propel him to fortune. Who knows?  Rating: *** (out of ****)  108 min/Released by Sony Pictures Classics'\n",
      " b\"The story started off well enough, but after just a bit, the FBI's NetForce started looking like a bunch of nerds playing in cyber-space. Trying to bust someone in a VR environment just wouldn't work. They TOLD the guy, and he just logged off! <sighs> Oh, well... then they went on to imply that the Internet was actually controllable... and could be shut off by someone attacking hardlines, satellites, or fiber optic lines... as if the users could actually tell what medium was being used for the transmission of their signals. <shakes his head> It could have been better, but I couldn't rate it too low, after all, it DID have a very good twist at the end (no spoiler here!), but even that part wasn't played out very well.  I hope to see more like it (but with better technical advice/support).\"], shape=(256,), dtype=string)\n"
